<p class="cap_1">TO all who desire to obtain an accurate
knowledge of the inner life of London, and
probably of all our large towns, and would
ascertain, by studying the results of experience,
the best mode of grappling with
its evils, the following pages will be deeply
interesting. They give the history and fruits of many
years' labour among the most filthy, destitute, and degraded
classes of the whole Metropolis. Yet these
classes are by no means the most hopeless. A grand
aggressive movement of Christianity against those
strongholds of vice, disease, and misery, would end in
a larger victory than in one of equal vigour against
the obstinacy and self-satisfaction of the great body of
the skilled artisans.</p>
</div>

<p>The publication of such papers is very important
in these days, when inquiry and discussion are busy
to discover the true secret of what is required at the
present crisis for dealing with the vast masses of the
people. So far as I can see, they have as yet reached
no other conclusion (whether it be avowed or not)<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[viii]</a></span>
than that all existing arrangements and organizations,
singly and collectively, are inadequate to the task.
The Established Church, by itself, is feeble; the Non-conformists
still more so. The two, working together
in harmony, might attain some happy issues; but,
even on the supposition of their cordial union, a new
machinery must be devised, as an adjunct to all our
actual systems of operation.</p>

<p>It is vain to conceive that bricks and mortar, and
the multiplication of churches and chapels, would
accomplish the purpose. The sudden exhibition of
many places of worship would rather avert than attract
the people, who, through our long neglect of them, are
full of prejudices and superstitions about such matters.
The money laid out on these edifices would be better
expended on an increase and maintenance of living
agents of every sort and degree, as manifold, as various,
and as special, as the wonderful congeries of human
beings to whom their efforts would be addressed.</p>

<p>All the several agencies now at work have their
merits, and the conductors of them can recite many
instances of real success. But there is a lower depth
into which we have to descend, and descend, not by fits
and starts, but regularly and systematically. It is the
steady continuity of the effort, and not its occasional
vigour, that will make the profound and lasting impression.
And this continuity cannot be kept up by
the committees and directors alone. It must draw<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix">[ix]</a></span>
the main force of its life from the zeal, the fervour, the
hearty feeling, and class-experience of the workers
themselves. They must be numerous and active, and
not a few of them be drawn from the very ranks they
are enlisted to assail. The first movements must be
made on individuals, or at most on twos and threes.
Every filthy court must be invaded, the dark and
terrible retreats be disturbed and enlightened. Such
labours may be&mdash;nay, will be&mdash;oppressive and revolting,
but perseverance will drive away discouragement.
Doubtless it is a fierce trial to stand day by day, and
hour by hour, face to face and hand to hand with the
inhabitants of these pestilential and gloomy recesses;
but patience for a while, and they may be brought
from the private conversation to the cottage lecture,
from the lecture to the mission-room, from the mission-room
to the church or chapel, from unqualified misery
to comparative joy. The condition of their dwellings
is an awful impediment; but even this, in many instances,
may be partially overcome. The cause is
great; and the blessing of God has ever rested on the
prayers and labours of those who have sought to comfort
and instruct the most suffering and degraded of
the children of men.</p>

<p>That such men are to be found, and that their efforts
enjoy no small success, is proved by the narratives of
this book. These excellent men have established the
principle, they have produced the results. It only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">[x]</a></span>
remains that many should arise to imitate their good
example, and extend, far and wide, the operation of
this wise and solid benevolence. And why should they
not arise, and in sufficient numbers?</p>

<p>It is a remarkable fact&mdash;but fact it is&mdash;that, by the
special mercy and Providence of God, a due supply of
agents, able and effective for such a career as this, can
ever be found by those who diligently seek them. Men
and women of true hearts, of earnest piety, and of
adequate powers, spring in abundance out of the less
affluent classes of society, and are trained for the
highest and noblest purposes. In what other way can
we account for the array of some 450 men of the
London City Mission, men with special zeal and special
fitness to go among the masses? How else for the
peaceful army of Bible-women and Bible-nurses? That
such large numbers should answer to the call, and that
so few, after trial, should be found unworthy of their
vocation, is a positive marvel, and proves that the slow
diffusion of what is good and restorative is due, not to
the lack of qualified agents, but to the parsimony of
those on whom God has bestowed the means of putting
His gifts into life and motion.</p>

<p>It is so&mdash;for these people, who thus devote themselves
to the cause of our Lord, must be fed and
clothed with the rest of mankind. "They that preach
the gospel, must live of the gospel;" and the rich of
the earth should be told that if the first and highest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xi" id="Page_xi">[xi]</a></span>
motive be wanting in their hearts, the second one may
be deserving of their serious consideration. These
agencies tend to the tranquillization of society; and as
a tranquillizing influence, they tend to the security of
property. Look at the results of the efforts of Miss de
Broen among the Communists of Belleville, and it will
be seen that by the spread of the gospel among those
terrible masses, a beginning has been made more likely
to establish a happier order of things than the indefinite
multiplication of soldiers and <i>gendarmerie</i>.</p>

<p>I know not how far these suggestions may recommend
themselves to the judgment of the public at large. I
offer them simply as the conclusions of long observation,
backed by the judgment of many far more experienced
than myself. It is at least worth while to
make the effort, and try to what extent we may
rouse and utilize the dormant qualities of the poorest
ranks of society. We may oftentimes discern delicacy
of feeling, honesty of character, and vigour of resolution,
among these degraded but immortal beings. With
many terrible exceptions, their parental affections are
strong; and it is touching to observe how even poverty,
weariness, and disease, are all, as it were, forgotten in
their desperate struggles to maintain their children.
Hidden beneath these sentiments there is a mighty
engine wherewith to begin the work.</p>

<p>Well, here they are! and here they will remain!
Will you leave them alone to fester and to die?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xii" id="Page_xii">[xii]</a></span>
But in festering and dying they will breed a moral,
and a political, if not a physical, epidemic.</p>

<p>Will you advance on them in their swarming retirements
of profligacy and pestilence? Why, then, there
is a hopeful promise that the Word of God shall not
return unto Him empty; and as the High Priest bore
on his turban, "Holiness to the Lord," so may the
missionaries&mdash;the agents, the men, the women, all who
go forth to this great enterprise&mdash;bear imprinted on
their foreheads, a motto of no inferior power, "<i>Christo
in pauperibus</i>."</p>

<div class="drop">
<img src="images/idrop_t.jpg" alt="T" width="66" height="107" class="cap" />
<p class="cap_1">THIS book was written in detached papers,
for <i>Evening Hours</i> and other Journals,
without any intention to republish them in
the form of a volume. Meagre details and
want of connection will thus be accounted
for. The narrative extends over a period
of many years, and is substantially true, although the
writer had to depend upon memory aided by a few
notes: verbal accuracy cannot therefore be expected.
The difficulty of recording the histories of individuals
and families in a few paragraphs, without their connecting
links, was felt, and this may have given a
touch of the wonderful to some incidents, which a
more full account would have avoided. The object
of the work, even in its detached papers, was to illustrate
the mode of Missionary visitation among the
very poor and the depraved classes; and to show
the power of simple teaching from the Word of God
among them.</p>
</div>

<p>The kindness of Lord Shaftesbury in writing the
Introduction, and of Mrs. Mary Sewell, in decorating<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiv" id="Page_xiv">[xiv]</a></span>
each chapter with extracts, is acknowledged with much
gratitude. Their assistance has enriched the volume,
and the writer has an impression that many will regard
it as an indifferent picture beautifully framed. Be
this as it may, he commits it to the indulgence of his
readers, and to the blessing of <i>Almighty God</i>, by the
power of whose Word alone the good narrated was
accomplished.</p>

<h3><a name="PREFACE_TO_THE_TENTH_EDITION" id="PREFACE_TO_THE_TENTH_EDITION"></a>PREFACE TO THE TENTH EDITION.</h3>


<p>The favour accorded to this book has taken the
author by surprise, as the issue of nine editions of a
thousand copies rapidly succeeded each other. The
truthfulness and simplicity of the narrative has no
doubt promoted this result, but the secret of its success
is not in the book itself, but in the deep interest taken
by Christians generally in effort to evangelize the
people of London.</p>

<p>To many the difficulty of uniting disciples of various
names in hearty co-operation appeared to be insurmountable;
and the gaining of access to and influencing
the "lapsed masses," the ungodly and criminal,
to religion and virtue seemed all but hopeless.</p>

<p>This simple record of mission work has had its influence
in removing such difficulties from the minds of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xv" id="Page_xv">[xv]</a></span>
many, and in enlisting the sympathy of persons who
were previously uninformed as to a Christian union
which is auxiliary and helpful to all the Churches.</p>

<p>At the time the narrative commenced there were only
one hundred and twelve city missionaries employed
in London; but, through the blessing of Almighty God
and the confidence of His people, the increase of their
number has been steady and support increasingly
generous. The mission staff now numbers 448 effective
men with 30 veterans upon the retiring fund; these,
with the committee and their officers, examiners of
candidates and local superintendents, number upwards
of one thousand men, who prayerfully and with great
activity seek the spiritual good and general uprising
of the poor of the great Metropolis.</p>

<p>Much remains to be done. In many parishes extending
to the distant suburbs there are numerous
poor districts, inhabited by myriads of perishing souls,
to each of which the appointment of "<span class="smcap">a Man with
the Book</span>," charged to read and bring its life-giving
power to bear upon each man, woman, and child within
his influence, would indeed be a blessing conferred.</p>

<p>Charged with the duty of providing for many of these
"waste places" in the east and west of the City, the
writer will gladly welcome the friendship and aid
of those who, realizing the preciousness of personal
salvation, from the abundance of the heart deviseth
liberal things.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xvi" id="Page_xvi">[xvi]</a></span></p>

<p>With the committee there is one strong conviction,
and it is this, that their work, which commenced in
obscurity and feebleness, by three men without name,
influence, or money, but who were strong in faith,
prayer, and holy zeal&mdash;that the effort though now exceeding
large&mdash;can only be continued and extended in
the same spirit of simple trust and devotion, "glory"
being rendered "in the Church by Jesus Christ, unto
Him that is able to do exceeding abundantly above all
that we can ask or think, according to the power
that worketh in us."</p>

<p class="cap_4">WHY the inhabitants called their place of
residence Paradise Court was never clearly
understood. The parochial authorities substituted
for the name of the garden of
primeval beauty that of a lovely southern
county of old England, and on their official
papers styled it Devonshire Place. Many would question
the propriety of the Court bearing either name, as
it forms the centre of a labyrinth of dirty overcrowded
streets. It is not a blind alley, as it is of elbow shape
with two entrances connecting streets, though only
used by persons of profound local knowledge. The
houses are so ill-shaped and dilapidated as to prejudice
the mind against London of the past generation; while
the murky atmosphere&mdash;the cloud of ragged yellowish
garments suspended from the upper windows by pole
and line&mdash;the narrowness of the passage-way, which
increases the thick darkness of night&mdash;the constant
noise made by the drunken and quarrelsome, render it a
place to be avoided by the respectable, however poor.</p>
</div>

<p>There were, however, at the time our narrative commences,
respectable visitors to the Court, and foremost
among them for intimate acquaintance with the community<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
was that valuable official the Relieving Officer.
His approach was by some mysterious means instantaneously
known, and produced wonderful effects;
unruly sounds were hushed, quite a number of poor
creatures were taken suddenly ill, and a most appalling
condition of poverty was created. Strange however
to say, his exit was marked by a revivifying influence,&mdash;low
muttering occasionally burst into storms
of abuse, but not until he had turned the corner; we
may therefore suppose that he was in happy ignorance
of the strong feeling which existed against him.</p>

<p>The policeman on duty used to pause, as from
professional instinct, when he passed each narrow
entrance, and at night had been known suddenly
to turn his bull's eye upon persons approaching or
leaving the Court. Occasionally a visit was paid by
that dreaded person, the Inspector: which event was
always unexpected. Intelligent members of the force
at a given moment took their position at either end,
while the Inspector marched with several officers to
a particular house, and then marched off with the
somebody he wanted. Next morning a company of
the inhabitants used to return the compliment, by
going in a body to the Police Court, and for days
after, the subject matter of conversation in the Court
was, "How the 'spector got that ere hinformation
what he received."</p>

<p>The postman occasionally entered the place, and
when he did so he grasped his letters firmly,&mdash;while
in order to effect a proper delivery he deciphered
strange hieroglyphics. Of course those true friends
of the poor, the parish and dispensary doctors, were
frequently to be seen in the place. They knew it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
well as a pestilent spot, and, while alleviating suffering,
gave many certificates for the burial of the dead.
As regards the living there was scanty record: the
name of the place being rarely if ever written in
the Vestry Register. A few out of the swarm of
dirty, shoeless, tattered little heathen (heathen in the
sense of being unbaptized and untaught in the Christian
religion) were occasionally hunted for by their
warm-hearted friend, the Ragged School teacher, who
had entered their names in his class book. With two
exceptions these were the only respectable visitors to
Paradise Court; and the exceptions only came on
Black-Monday morning. One was the stern broker-man,
who represented the landlord of half the houses,
and whose terrible utterance, "Pay the rent, or I will
chuck your sticks into the Court," had a money-producing
effect. The other Monday visitor was a lady of
peculiar style, who entered the place from her suburban
residence exactly at nine o'clock. Though shabby in
dress, it was believed by her thirty-four miserable
tenants that she was a real lady at home. She was
fluent of speech, and gave many reasons why it would
be wrong of her to let the rent run on. She had
never been known to comprehend an excuse; and it
was an established fact that business friendship existed
between her and that dreadful broker-man.</p>

<p>To this succession of official and other visitors another
was to be added. The Paradise people knew
it not; and, if they had, he would not have been
received with demonstrations of joy; indeed the few
persons who one March morning noticed two men in
conversation at the narrow entrance of the Court,
were made uncomfortable, as they could not comprehend<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
what was meant. "I wonders if they are
a coming down here," observed one woman to another.
"They aint mendicities," she replied; and
hastened to inform her companion lodgers "that
something was up, as two men, one of them an old-un,
with a brown coat, and the tother a young-un
nearly all black, was a talking and looking down."
A rush to the doors and windows took place, but
they only saw the two men part company. The
eldest walked away and the other entered the open
door of the first house.</p>

<p>To remove all mystery,&mdash;the old gentleman was the
training Superintendent of the London City Mission,
and his companion a young Missionary whom he was
placing upon the district. They had walked round it
together, and stopping at the Court, the Superintendent
said to his young friend, "You will find this the most
trying part of the district, as the people are in a bad
state, and have never as yet been visited. Enter the
first house, make your way to the top back room&mdash;visit
as you come down, and in this way press through
the place. Remember it is your duty to make the
acquaintance of every man, woman, and child, for the
purpose of bringing them to a knowledge of salvation
by our Lord Jesus Christ, and of doing them good by
every means in your power: go, and may the Lord
prosper you."</p>

<p>A poet would have called that a sublime moment
for the young Missionary: he was in possession of
that which had for three years been the desire of his
heart&mdash;the office of accredited visitor to the poor.
For this he had prayed, studied, and passed the required
examination; and it was with grateful heart<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
and elastic step, that he made his way up the rickety
stair-case, and approached the room to the occupiers
of which he was first to deliver his message. A
noise,&mdash;the beating of leather upon lapstones, required
that a second and harder tap should be given
at the door. It was suddenly opened by a middle-aged
man, of ruffianly appearance, with a long black
beard. In his hand was a large flat hammer, and in
his mouth a short black pipe. With a sharp look at the
stranger, he inquired, "Do you want me, Master?" "I
am a Missionary," was the reply, "and am come to
make your acquaintance. Will you accept one of these
tracts?" The man threw open the door, and said to his
companions,&mdash;"This is a religious chap, and wants to
know me." The visitor stepped in and gave a curious
glance round the room. It was an attic of about ten
feet square, with a low roof. In the centre was a heap of
old boots and shoes, rubbish of the kind collected from
dust heaps; round them were six men of various ages,
and offensively dirty; beside each were several rows of
restored articles. It was evident that the men were
"translators,"&mdash;cobblers, who by marvellous skill in
their art were turning destroyed shoes into articles
fit for use. "If he's religious," exclaimed a man of
diminutive stature, "I'm the customer for him;" and
facing the visitor, demanded "Do you believe in a Supernatural
Being? because," he continued, "if you do, I
don't. He is a fool who says in his heart there is no
God, and he is a fool who says there is one, because
there is no proof." "Nature and the Bible"&mdash;replied
the Missionary; but he could get no further, as at
the mention of the Book exclamations of doubt and of
abuse were uttered. He tried to proceed, but was cried<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
down. As he turned away, the man who opened the
door, said, with angry looks, "Now mind, Guv'nor, I am
master here, and I live in the next room, and my
children knows nothing of superstition, and if you come
here with your cant I'll pitch you down." There was a
momentary pause, which enabled the visitor to exclaim
in a clear ringing voice, "This day has salvation come
to this house," and he then descended to the next
landing.</p>

<p>Upon the back-room door was a rusty old padlock,
showing that the lodgers&mdash;costermongers&mdash;were out;
but the front-room door was partly open. "Come in,"
said a feeble voice; and the visitor, though nearly
stopped by the offensiveness of the room, stepped in,
and found it a death chamber. A woman and child
were upon the bed in a high state of fever; and stark
upon the floor, with face uncovered, lay the body of a
boy of six years. The scene so shocked the inexperienced
visitor, that he with sorrow expressed his
regret at finding them in such a position, and inquired
about the husband. "He is a chanter, sir," she replied,
"and is out in the streets singing about the man who
was hung on Monday morning. He was cut up when
Bobby died in the night, and said that he would leave
off singing when he had got half-a-crown, and come
home." While words of consolation were being read,
the "chanter" entered the room: his clothes were
threadbare, his face pallid, and his voice husky. The
stranger put his hand kindly upon the arm of the poor
man, and expressed his sympathy for the bereavement
he had suffered, and added, "I have read to your wife
from the Bible, and am about to pray: let us kneel
down." At the mention of prayer an expression of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
contempt passed over the man's face, and he hurriedly
left the room. Prayer was however offered, and the
visitor descended to the parlours: oh, such parlours!</p>

<p>The back was occupied by an aged woman, who no
doubt collected bones and rags from the streets, as the
floor was nearly covered with them. She was frying
fish which was partly putrid, and was so earnest in
declaring her poverty (no doubt truthfully) that the
visitor had to assure her that he had no temporal relief
to bestow. The same plea of poverty was urged by
three drunken-looking women who stood at the next
door; upon his telling them that he had no money to
give, but that he hoped to make them happy with the
true riches, they shut the door in his face; and stepping
out he breathed the refreshing air of the Court.</p>

<p>Two more houses were passed through with varied
success, and the visitor left for rest and refreshment.
Upon his return it was evident that his fame had spread,
as there were groups of persons ready to look at him,
and in that look there was a hostile expression. True
to his instructions, he merely gave tracts to several
women who asked for them, and then made his way to
the fourth house. Though all the front doors were open,
and had the appearance of never being closed night
or day, that door was shut and fastened, and peals of
laughter could be heard inside, while the Missionary in
vain knocked for admission. He went to the next
house, but was brought to a pause while ascending the
upper stairs by the barking of dogs. The door of the
front attic was opened by a woman: at the sight of the
stranger she screamed her command for silence, and the
brutes became dumb. As she opened the door half way
a curious sight presented itself: upon the bed were five<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
or six puppies of various breeds, and chained to the
floor was a white bull terrier of savage mien, while an
ugly cur raised his nose to the edge of the basket in
which he was reposing, and sustained a growl of low
note. Bobbing a curtsey, she said in a plaintive tone,
"I can't ask you in, sir, as the dogs are werry savage;
but though I does try to get a honest living, a ticket is
as acceptable to me as to them wretches what has got
into the first floor." In answer to the inquiry, "How do
you live?" she replied, "I brings up little dogs for fancy
men, and takes in sick uns to nurse, and I earns my
money I can tell you: why that ere bull-dog has the
mange, and I have to rub him in with doctor's stuff, and
if I didn't muzzle him, and pull his chain tight to the
floor, he'd tear me to pieces; and then I have to get up
in the night to feed the puppies with milk." When the
matter of religion was referred to, she in an angry tone
said, that she "knowed what was right, and didn't want
to be preached at." The sagacious friends of man
understood that altered tone of voice, and recommenced
growling and barking. As it was hopeless trying to make
himself heard at the next room, the visitor descended to
make acquaintance with the abused in the first floor.</p>

<span class="caption">&quot;I brings up little dogs for fancy men, and takes in sick uns to nurse.&quot;</span>
</div>

<p>Both doors were open, and the lodgers were in evident
expectation of a visit. In the front room were three
men and four women: the men had cotton handkerchiefs
of a reddish colour about their necks, their hair
being arranged in the peculiar curl round the ear known
in their circle as the Newgate cut. One of them, with
an air of blandness, offered the visitor a chair, and said,
"I am always glad to see a Missionary gent. Where I
comes from, near Petticoat Lane, is one of them, maybe
you knows him: he's werry good to chaps that gets into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
trouble. Now this woman has got a boy as is always
unlucky: he went a lifting and got nabbed first time,
and got a week, as he wasn't known; after that he
hopped over a wall for something, and a Bobby was
down on him, and for that he got a month; and then he
relieved a gent of his ticker, and for that he's doing four
months upon the mill, and I think that he ought to be
reformed. He'll be out on Monday, and if you will tell
me where you live, I will bring him to you, and you can
put him somewhere. If you doesn't he'll be into trouble
again, because, as I says, he's unlucky." The reasons
given were not likely to stimulate zeal, but the Missionary
arranged to see the young thief immediately after
his discharge from prison. A friendly conversation,
followed, and several young girls and juvenile thieves,
who came in from the other room, remained to hear the
Bible read. The evil consequences of sin were pointed
out to them, and the way of salvation was explained.
Deep emotion was expressed by several of these depraved
persons, and there was a friendly parting.</p>

<p>Upon the ground floor a fragrance redolent of sea-weeds
filled the air, and was a pleasant relief from the
state of the atmosphere upstairs. The cause of this
strange perfume was apparent upon the door of the
back room being opened by an old man, who appeared
as if he was undergoing a salivating process. The
floor was covered with baskets and trays with piles of
whelks upon them, some of which were cooked and some
were not. As the man was rather deaf, it was difficult to
make him understand the object of the visit; but when
he did so, he asked the stranger in. He refused an
offered tract, with the remark, "I ain't got no larning,
Mister, and I burns every bit of paper I gits, so it 'ould<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
be smoke if you comed for it. I cooks these whelks for
chaps and women as stands with stalls, and gets a penny
a kettleful." When told "that at his age the great
matter was not his business, but his fitness for a better
world," he laughed and said, "All I want is to die easy,
so I moves the things, and puts my mattress the right
way, as we never knows what may be, and they says
as it's hard to die the cross-way of boards." He was
told that "to pray to the great God in the name of
Jesus for pardon and His Holy Spirit, was the way for
old people to be made happy, and to die easy." But he
looked vacant, as though the subjects of pardon and
immortality were strange to him. Upon his saying
that cooking was over early in the evening, the visitor
showed him the Bible, and said, "This was written by
the good Father in heaven, and I will come some evening
and read out of it." He looked pleased as he
approached his fish-kettle, and the visitor was then glad
to make his escape from a kind of warm sea-fog.</p>

<p>The next house was filled with beggars. The rooms
were filthy; and upon entering them in succession, the
women and children commenced in the cadgers' whine
to beg. "Why don't you wash your children?" was
inquired of a mother, whose four little ones were as
black as sweeps. "We haven't a penny," was the reply,
"to buy soap with, and the little dears are so uncomfortable
like when they wakes up, until they rubs their
faces well with their hands, which freshens them up."
Their hard begging prevented religious conversation.
In the front parlour a man, clothed in filthy raiment,
was smoking his pipe, while the wife was engaged in
sweeping with an almost hairless broom. An attempt
to speak to them upon the Gospel message provoked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">&nbsp;</a></span>
an outburst of low abuse from them both: the woman,
who was evidently from the Emerald Isle, followed the
visitor to the door, giving a long sweep with her broom;
and then flourishing it over his head as he stepped into
the Court, exclaimed, "Och, and sure and that's the
way I sweep out rubbish!" After failing to convey
religious instruction to the people at the next house,
where the woman and youth abused, and the children
yelled as he passed out, the young Missionary left the
place in a state of mind exactly opposite to that in
which he had entered it in the morning. A sense of
inefficiency, of utter disqualification for the work, had
taken possession of his mind and damped his zeal.
To have instructed the respectable poor&mdash;to have
removed the difficulties of men in error, would have
been a pleasure; but to evangelize such a people as the
dwellers in Paradise Court and its surroundings seemed
hopeless. Besides the offensiveness of the work&mdash;the
thought of spending six or more hours daily in those
wretched dwellings, subjected to risk of contagion,
insult, and personal violence, and that with such feeble
hope of benefiting the people, produced a sense of regret
that the effort had been made. So powerfully did these
reasons act, that the Missionary availed himself of the
consideration that Saturday would be an inconvenient
day for the people, and stayed away; but on Sunday
afternoon, about three o'clock, he approached the Court
with a faint heart, and a bundle of tracts in his hand.</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 361px;">
<img src="images/i036.jpg" width="361" height="500" alt="&quot;Where the woman and youth abused, and the children yelled as he passed out.&quot;" title="Poor Children" />
<span class="caption">&quot;Where the woman and youth abused, and the children yelled as he passed out.&quot;</span>
</div>

<p>At the entrance a group of about fifteen roughs were
talking together. Tracts were offered to each. One
of them, a man of heavy frame and unprepossessing
countenance, arising from the circumstance that it was
deeply scarred, and had the bridge of the nose broken,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
approached the Missionary. With a smile more awe-inspiring
than ordinary frowns, he inquired, "Are you
the chap what's coming to all our rooms to make us
religious?" To so direct a question only one reply
could be given, which was hopefully in the affirmative.
"Then," he continued, that dreadful smile deepening
into an expression of malice, as he raised his huge fist,
"then don't come to my room; which is good advice,
cos I does three things at once when I'm up. I'm
known in the ring as a hard hitter, and I've fixed the
ring stakes for lots of battles,&mdash;and this is what I does:
I deposits my fist on the top of the nose, which leaves
a mark, and shuts up both peepers for a week or two."
"Well, but members of the prize ring are honourable
in this," was the prompt reply: "they never strike men
who cannot box." The man seemed pleased with the
compliment, but his companions gave an incredulous
look, as much as to say, "We, alas, know better!"</p>

<p>Friendly words were spoken, and tracts given to
persons standing at their doors. While thus engaged
the Missionary was stayed by a sound which proceeded
from an upper room. It fell so strangely upon the ear
that he stood still and gazed up at the windows, with
the exclamation upon his lips&mdash;"Surely the Lord has
His hidden ones in this place." An effort was evidently
being made in one of the rooms to sing a song of
praise. A cracked female voice was trying to lead other
voices, not one of which had been attuned to melody,
in singing the hymn&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<span class="i0">"Come ye that love the Lord,</span><br />
<span class="i0">And let your joys be known."</span><br />
</div>

<p>A woman at one of the windows, seeing the astonishment
of the visitor, said, "It's Widow Peters, Master<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
having a meeting: she lives here in the first back.
She's a good un: the dear old soul is like a mother to
us." The visitor approached the room, and as the
singing ceased, opened the door. He saw at a glance
that the company consisted of five very poor women.
Four were seated upon the frame of the bedstead, and
another at the table, upon which lay an open Bible and
Hymn-book. "This is he," exclaimed one of the
women. "This is the tract man, who is coming to
read to us out of the blessed Book." Upon this the
widow rose, her countenance beaming with holy joy,
and with that graceful dignity which religious life often
confers upon the poor, offered her hand to the Missionary,
exclaiming, "Come in, sir, come in, and let us
praise the Lord together. I have pleaded with Him for
poor souls in this place, and now He has sent His
messenger with glad tidings. May the Lord bless you
to many." This welcome was given with such genuine
feeling that the "messenger" was overpowered. The
speaker was aged; quite seventy years had whitened
her few remaining hairs and given a decrepit appearance
to her slender frame; but under the influence of
strong religious feeling she stood erect, and the feebleness
of her voice gave peculiar force to words which
entered the soul. The poor women felt it as they stood
with tearful eyes; and the young Missionary felt it, for
his only answer was an affectionate holding of that
withered hand in his, and a reverential gazing into the
face of the old disciple.</p>

<p>The meeting was soon brought to a close, but the
aged woman and the young man remained in earnest
conversation, as though they had enjoyed years of
friendship. How strong is that cord of love in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
spirit, which binds believers together because of union
with the living Jesus! "The poor creatures down here
are in dreadful darkness, and many are awfully wicked,"
observed the widow; "and my heart leapt for joy when
I was told that a tract man was trying to speak with
people in their rooms: it was such a faithful answer to
prayer." "And who prayed for my coming?" was inquired.
"I had heard of missionary gentlemen visiting
other places," she replied, "and about two months ago
it was laid on my heart to pray for my perishing neighbours,
and I cried day and night unto the Lord."</p>

<p>"About that time," observed the visitor, "a few
believers met in the house of a Tunbridge Wells tradesman,
to pray for a blessing upon the poor of London.
They then agreed to raise support for a Missionary to
one of the most necessitous districts, and wrote a letter
to the Committee of the London City Mission to that
effect. While the gentlemen were considering the matter
they had their attention drawn to this neighbourhood
through the opening of an Infidel Hall just by. At
that time, after much prayer, I made application to be
received as one of their agents. They approved of me
and sent me here. But how strange it was, that in this
place prayer should at that time have been offered for
the same object." "Oh, no! that was not strange,"
she replied; "for the same Spirit dwells in all the
disciples, and according to the Divine Mind and Will,
teaches them what to pray for, and now we must plead
for souls and these dry bones shall live." "After spending
Friday at the other end of the place," observed the
Missionary, "I was led to despair of doing any good
here, as the people are so ignorant, hardened, and
offensive. I have thought that an experienced visitor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
ought to come here in my stead." With a look of
sorrow and reproof the old Christian exclaimed: "The
Lord has sent you here with the Gospel plough, and
don't look back. Go on, dear friend, and He will bless
His faithful servant." In answer to the inquiry, "How
long she had known the Lord, and why she was living
in that place?" she replied, "I am the widow of a
soldier: thirty-six years ago I was abroad with the
regiment, and was converted at a soldiers' prayer-meeting.
I then joined the Wesleyans, and have met in
class ever since. I had a daughter, who was married
to a bricklayer who took to drinking and used her
badly. He brought her down here, and then I took a
room in the same house to look after her. She died two
years ago. I have three shillings weekly from the
parish, and I make up by doing a little washing for
young people at a draper's. I stop here now, as no
one would rob or injure me; and many a poor creature
will let me nurse them a little when they are ill, and
then I speak to them about Jesus, and pray for their
poor souls. Now you have come they must all hear the
truth. Don't, sir, leave the poor perishing souls." At
parting each offered prayer. The aged widow with
tremulous voice and holy earnestness pleaded with God
for the young messenger, and for the sinners around her,
mentioning several by name. Her language was that
of one who for years had had free access to the Holy
Place, and to whom power had been given to wrestle
with God and to prevail.</p>

<p>That prayer was blessed to the young Missionary.
As he stepped into the Court he felt that the coward
spirit had left him, and that he had received power to
intercede with the Almighty for perishing souls. His<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
heart was too full to speak to the people; but, as he
passed their doors, a cry of holy desire for their salvation
(that best preparation for the work of an Evangelist)
ascended to where Jesus the Mediator is seated at the
right hand of God.</p>

<p class="cap_4">MONDAY morning cast its usual gloom over
Paradise Court in the persons of the rent
collectors. Many of the men and women
had gone out upon various callings, and
others, whose supply of ready cash fell short
of the required amount, absented themselves,
leaving messages with the children, in some
cases with, and in others without, part payment. The
Court therefore had the appearance of quietness and
moral respectability as the Missionary passed down.
His step was firm, and his countenance wore an expression
of decision. He had realized the difficulties of the
position; and in calm reliance upon the help of Almighty
God, had come to the prayerful decision that he
would faithfully discharge the duties of his office. That
day and many others of toil passed before each room
had been visited. As the people became familiar with
their new friend, the spirit of opposition, with a few
exceptions, gave way to one of utter indifference. Three
months passed before the statistics of the place were
taken, and then the startling discovery was made that
in that block of buildings there were one hundred and
ninety-four rooms, occupied by two hundred and sixteen
families, as several let corners of their rooms to lodgers.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
The population consisted of three hundred and eighty-six
adult persons, with more than double that number of
children. Only nine Bibles could be found in the place,
and upon the morning of the Lord's day only two persons
left its precincts to worship God in His temple.
As month after month of stair-treading and of effort to
secure attention passed away, the Missionary became
discouraged, from the seeming impossibility of effecting
any good in that valley of spiritual death. The children,
to be sure, had been won by looks and words of
kindness. They gathered round him out of doors, and
looked for his smile as he approached the rooms. And
then the people had become familiar with the pocket
Bible, and cast glances at it as the reader held it in his
hand, as though they had some mysterious interest in its
contents. But this was all. No reformation had been
wrought, no inquiry for salvation had been made; and
despair of blessing was overclouding the soul of the
Missionary, when a circumstance occurred which caused
hope, like a day star, to dispel the darkness. That circumstance
was a fight in the Court.</p>
</div>

<p>One afternoon he was praying with a sick man in an
upper room when his voice was drowned by screams,
shouts, and yells in the Court below. Rising from his
knees, he opened the window, and shuddered at the
revolting scene which presented itself. Two women,
whose vile language had several times repelled him from
their doors, had quarrelled and been ejected from a neighbouring
gin-bar. Upon reaching home they commenced
fighting; and being inflamed with liquor, they had torn
each other's clothes, and their faces were bleeding. In
their fury they had seized each other by the hair, and
lay struggling on the ground. A number of men and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
women had formed a ring, and were urging them on to
the brutal conflict; while the people crowded to their
windows, and shouted advice according to the side they
took. It was a shocking display of rage and blood and
blasphemy; but it was brought to a sudden close. Some
one looked up and raised the cry, "The Bible-man is
there!" Every face was turned up, and then the people
drew in their heads and closed the windows. The crowd
in the Court dispersed, many running like rabbits in at
their doors. The sudden silence caused the wretched
women to disengage themselves and to look up. They
caught the steady gaze of the man who had spoken to
them of God and judgment, and one of them with a
bound sprang into her dwelling; while the other covered
her lacerated face with her apron, and staggered into
her door-way. A few minutes after, when the Missionary
passed out of the Court, all was silence,&mdash;not a being
was to be seen; but upon the pavement were spots of
blood and pieces of hair. Though saddened, he felt
thankful for the influence he had obtained. It would
have taken several policemen to have quelled that disturbance;
but to have subdued it by moral, or rather
religious force, was indeed a triumph and earnest of
future good.</p>

<p>About a month after this event a sudden outbreak of
scarlet and typhoid fever brought distress into fourteen
families, but resulted in much good to the inhabitants.
The parish doctor had ordered the removal of a woman
to the infirmary, and two old workhouse men came
with a covered stretcher for that purpose. The lodgers
had noticed spots upon the patient, and raised a report
of black fever. They were in a state of panic, and no
person but the widow would approach the room. She<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
found the Missionary, who was visiting in other houses,
and told him that she had prepared the poor woman for
her removal; but that the old men were not strong
enough to carry her, and none of the neighbours would
assist them. Upon this he followed her to the room,
and taking the poor fever-stricken creature in his arms,
carried her down and laid her gently on the stretcher.
The people stood afar off; but, as their visitor left by
the side of the stretcher, he caught a murmur of thankfulness.
Upon his return from the workhouse he was
received with a demonstration of gratitude; and seizing
the opportunity, he said, "Tell the men that I want to
speak to them, and that they will do me a kindness by
being here this evening at seven o'clock. I want them to
help me turn the fever out: not a man must be absent."</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 331px;">
<img src="images/i049.jpg" width="331" height="500" alt="&quot;The visitor sprang on to a costermonger&#39;s barrow, and waving his hand, exclaimed&mdash;&quot;" title="Missionary Making Speech" />
<span class="caption">&quot;The visitor sprang on to a costermonger&#39;s barrow, and waving his hand, exclaimed&mdash;&quot;</span>
</div>

<p>When at the appointed time the Missionary turned
the corner, he was surprised to see the place crowded.
It was evident that the men had rallied in their strength,
and they began to cheer. The visitor sprang on to a
costermonger's barrow, and waving his hand, exclaimed,
"Many of our neighbours are ill, and we must for their
sakes, poor things, be quiet. I thank you for mustering
so strong; it shows that you have a good feeling toward
me, and as I have a good feeling toward you, why, we
are friends. Now, as a true friend, I am going to speak
to you plainly, as we can't turn out the fever unless we
work together. I expected this fever to come (murmurs);
and this is why. You have not enough air and
water down here, and you don't make the best use of
what you have. If a man drinks poison he is killed
by it, and if he breathes poisoned air he is killed in
a slower way by getting weak, or having illnesses like
the fever. Many of you sleep six or ten in a room, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30"></a></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29"></a></span>
always keep the windows shut. This poisons the air.
And now about the water. To-morrow morning every
butt must be cleansed; and let each person, when the
flow is on, throw a pailfull down their yard and another
into the Court. Mind two pailfulls for each person.
And then you must wash yourselves more frequently.
There are sensible women here who wash their children
every day; there are others that do not. Now let the
sensible women do a kind thing: let them give the dirty
children a good scrubbing on the sly. (Laughter, and
cries of 'We will.') And mind, all the rooms and stairs
must be scrubbed. That's for the women: now for the
men. You must whitewash your rooms. ('Let the landlords
do it.') If you wait until they do it, some of you
will be in your graves first. ('That's right.') Do it
yourselves. A pail of whitewash is only the price of a
pot of beer. ('That's it.') When you have done it, I
will ask the collectors to allow you back the half-pence.
('Thank'ee, sir,' etc.) Another thing shall be done: I
will see the officer of health, and, if necessary, the vestry
gentlemen, and ask them to improve your drainage and
water supply." (Here the fighting man raised his fist
and exclaimed, "If they don't!" as though his system
of deposit would of a certainty influence the local parliament.)
"And then," the speaker continued, "we must
keep sober. The fever is fond of drunkards, with their
horrid breath and weak bodies, and lays hold of them
first. (Sensation.) Now, to turn the fever out, you
must promise me three things: say Yes, after each of
them. Good use of air and water ('Yes, yes'); every
room to be whitewashed ('Yes, yes'); and a sober
Saturday night." (Murmurs.) The speaker repeated
the last sentence in a tone of firm command: "A sober<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
Saturday night!" and received a shout of "Yes, yes,
yes!" Then, taking the Bible from his pocket, he held
it up, and in a subdued voice continued, "There is a
great Father up there, who loves us all; but you don't
pray Him to take care of you and your children. On
Sunday morning you hear the bells ring; but none of
you go to church. This is
wrong of you. Remember
He has had it written down
in His Holy Book that
'the curse of the Lord is in
the house (the room) of the
wicked; but He blesseth
the habitation of the just.'"
There was a solemn pause,
and the speaker sprang from
his uncomfortable stand and
passed out at the short end
of the place.</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 127px;">
<img src="images/i052.jpg" width="127" height="250" alt="Drunken Sammy leaning on post" title="Drunken Sammy" />

</div>

<p>One man had evidently
absented himself from the
sanitary meeting. This was
plain, as Drunken Sammy
approached, followed by an
admiring crowd of boys and
low people. This old man
had been a drunkard for
many years, and his neighbours used to say that he
had become worse since he had had "something" upon
his mind; this "something" being the fact that his wife
was made ill by one of his beatings when drunk, and
only lived two months after. He was a slop tailor, and
used at times to work hard and remain sober for days<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
together. During several of these intervals he had
listened to the Christian teacher, and promised reformation;
but he had lost the power of moral control. His
habit was to stand in a gin-bar from early in the morning;
when his money was spent he would take his coat
to a neighbouring dolly or leaving-shop. Soon after
he would return and leave his waistcoat and shoes.
When the proceeds of these were spent, he was of course
ejected. Upon this he commenced vagaries of the most
comical kind; gesticulating and tumbling, while shouting
lines from comic songs. His rule was to enter the
Court by attempting a leapfrog over the posts at the
corner; and he often fell with terrible force upon the
pavement, to the great diversion of the public. He was
always received by his neighbours with roars of laughter
as they rushed to see the fun. On this occasion, however,
he met with an altered reception. The presence
of the Missionary, who had returned, at his side, and
the subduing influence of the meeting, had its effect.
"Here's that fool of a Sammy," exclaimed one of the
women who had engaged in the fight we have narrated:
while others looked at him with contempt,&mdash;all with indifference.
It was much for her to call a drunkard "a
fool," and for her friends to acknowledge the fact. As
the woman lived in the same house with the drunkard,
the visitor looked at her and said, "Take care of this
poor man for me, and don't let him out until I call tomorrow
afternoon." "We won't let him out!" exclaimed
several voices: and the woman seized his arm
and thrust him into the house. A smile played over the
anxious face of the Missionary, for well he knew that
the woman would keep her word, and that poor Sammy
was <i>in durance vile</i>. What for him availed the British<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
Constitution,&mdash;Magna Charta, the Bill of Rights, and all
the legal apparatus which in these fair isles of liberty
protect the subject? He is under arrest. Let us hope
that it will be for his good.</p>

<p>Next morning, on his way to the Court House, the
Missionary had occasion to call upon an "elect lady,"
who was then the daughter, and who is now the widow
of a general officer. He told her about the soldier's
widow,&mdash;her deep piety, and her love for souls, and her
poverty; and while he did so, the full sympathy of
another Christian heart was drawn out in behalf of his
poor people. Upon his leaving, the lady said, "I will
pay the widow's rent, and will supply her with comforts
during the coming winter. Let her call upon me to-morrow,
as I may through her take a deeper interest in
your mission." The day had far advanced before the
pleasant message could be delivered: the bearer of it
had obtained an interview with the vestry clerk, which
resulted in his introduction to the parochial officer of
health, who was so kind as to accompany him to the
district. As they entered the place, its cleanly appearance,
the result of a deluge of water, and the healthy
smell of lime which pervaded the air, took the medical
gentleman by surprise. This was so opposite to the account
he had received, that the visitor, for his veracity's
sake, had to acquaint him with the events of the day
before, and to give an account of the speech from the
barrow. "A division of labour," he said drily: "and
you are welcome thus to usurp my duties for the whole
parish. As regards this place, I will make such a report
that the drainage shall be set right." As they repassed
a door, a rough woman, who was standing as on guard,
said to the Missionary, "Sammy has been obstreperous,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
sir, but I wouldn't let him out; and now he is quiet, as
the widow has gone into his room with her teapot." As
she mentioned the teapot her eyes twinkled with that
expression of good humour which lit up all the eyes in
Paradise Court when that valuable article was referred
to. No remarks were ever ventured, though much was
understood. We however will break the spell, and
though the officer of health is present, will vote the
matter urgent, and narrate its fame.</p>

<p>That old brown teapot was bought at the wayside,
and only cost threepence, as there was a chip upon the
spout. It had however by association with its owner,
acquired a value and a charm. In addition to the
wonder of the inexhaustible bottle, it had certain high
qualities. The very sick, and poor mothers with young
infants, were each convinced that they had the first of
the brew, and "that such a delicious cup of tea as that
never was." And when the owner had refreshed herself,
they were many who had a reversionary interest in its
contents. There was a power of moral elevation about
the article. Many a hard face assumed for the moment
a benign expression, and many a knitted brow relaxed
as the widow stepped from the door, threw her white
apron over the teapot, and with an almost girlish trip
passed into the room of some neighbour, who to equal
poverty added sickness or some distress. And then an
influence of sympathy attended the outpouring of its
contents. Her supply of milk usually cost one farthing,
and this she economised by pouring part of it in with
the tea. In her pocket she carried a few pieces of lump
sugar screwed up in a piece of paper, and thus the opportunity
to be courteous was given, as each person had it
sweetened to their liking. And, oh, who can tell how<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
many words of motherly advice and Christian counsel
were uttered over that old teapot? As the gentlemen
stood at the door they heard a feeble voice uttering
mighty truths; and stepping softly into the passage,
caught the end of the conversation. "I know that I
must have killed her," groaned drunken Sammy, "as I
beat her so hard; and if the jury didn't say so, the
coroner went on at me afterwards, and I'm so miserable
that I wish I was dead." "You are a poor sinner,
Sammy," said the widow; "but the blessed Lord died
for you, and you musn't look so much into yourself.
Now you feel how bad you are, you must look to the
dear <i>Jesus</i>. One drop of His blood makes you clean
and happy. Do, Sammy, let me pray with you." The
listeners stepped out gently; and the sanitary officer,
with ill-concealed emotion inquired about the strange
couple, and then he said, "Send the old woman to my
house, and I will give her some medicine for that drunken
fellow which will stay his craving for spirits, and so assist
your effort for his reformation."</p>

<p>Upon leaving the Place the visitors stopped to speak
with a group of four men who were standing at the
entrance. One of them wore a fantail cap, and held a
shovel and dust-basket. Another was an unmistakable
scavenger, as he had a scoop-shovel, and was bespattered
with mud. The others were so dirty as to make the impression
that they were close friends, if not near relations
of the former. "You have knocked off early," observed
the Missionary, looking with kindness into the face
of the dustman. "No we ain't, mister," replied that
worthy: "we are a-goin' to clean out all through. We
split the luck (money given to dustmen) last night, and
I didn't wash the dust down, as we says, and I'm givin'<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
summut to these chaps what's going to help; and the
carts are comin'." "That's the right thing for you to
do," was the encouraging remark. "An' if we be in the
muck," observed the scavenger, "we can be good, as you
speachified." "The dirt of your business is outside," was
the reply, "but it's the dirt inside that is bad; and this
will be taken away, if like a king we read about in the
Bible, we pray, 'Create in me a clean heart, O God.' I
will call at your rooms very soon."</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 216px;">
<img src="images/i057.jpg" width="216" height="250" alt="Man carrying bundle on his back" title="Man Carrying Bundle" />
</div>

<p>"To influence such people to act for themselves in
these matters is the solution of the sanitary question,"
observed the official. "The putting of pure thoughts
into their minds," replied the visitor, "is the secret, and
this is a Bible work, for the saying of the wise man is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
true of us all: 'As a man thinketh in his heart, so is
he.'"</p>

<p>The bearer of the message which was to gladden the
widow's heart that evening, retraced his steps and found
her in her room. She had fixed her spectacles, and was
intent upon finding a suitable Scripture for the poor
distressed drunkard she had just left. Some minutes
passed before she could realize the good that had befallen
her, and then she turned rapidly to the hundred
and third Psalm, and repeated rather than read the
words, "Bless the Lord, O, my soul; and all that is
within me, bless His holy name. Bless the Lord, O my
soul, and forget not all His benefits." She then said
calmly, "It's the Lord's doings. He knows how feeble
I am getting, and how hard it is for me to do the little
bit of work, so He is crowning my days with mercy, and
blessed be His name."</p>

<p>Next morning the widow called upon her lady, and
from that time a sweet expression of peace settled upon
her countenance. Her scanty raiment gave place to a
thick warm dress; and it was plain that a gracious hand
had bestowed the woollen shawl upon her shoulders,
because a judge of such articles would tell at a glance
that it had been wrought by delicate fingers. And from
that time her tea-pot became invested with a new
charm, as its contents never deteriorated in quality. A
new influence was also felt by her neighbours. The
sweep, who lived in the corner house, once said bitterly,
"Down here we are all by God and man forsaken."
This was no longer the case. The man with the Book,
acquainted them with the tender mercies of the <i>Most
High</i>, and the entrance of that Word which gives light
was leading one and another to call Him "<i>Abba&mdash;Father</i>."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
And then the expression of sweet sympathy in their
trials and sufferings, though it came from an unknown
source, softened hard hearts and prepared them for the
reception of the Gospel. The chanter was subdued by
the food given to his only child when again ill, and the
warm covering for its bed was among the influences
which led him to acknowledge God, and to bend his
stubborn knee. A young labourer who had been long
out of employment was saved from the first step in
crime by a pick-axe and shovel being provided for him
when he received the offer of work as a navvy, while
several basket-women and others who lived by street
trading were helped by small loans and gifts of money
to recover their position, when some misfortune or
difficulty had deprived them of their means of support.
This kindliness was to them strange, because
altogether out of their experience, and it exerted a
daily and increasing influence for good upon many
of them. The sick were often relieved from the intense
misery which cold and hunger and family wants
bring to them; while mothers, who had become brutalized
through separation from all that was holy and
elevating, were won and uplifted by acts of kindness
shown to their children by the stranger-friend. That
mighty force in the up-raising of the debased and depraved,
which we will venture to call lady-power, was
evidently at work in Paradise Court; and to this must
be ascribed very much of the good which resulted. Oh,
ye handmaidens of the Lord, successors of the holy
women who ministered to His wants, and who followed
Him even to Calvary, it is your high privilege, like Him,
to stoop to those of low estate; and to minister of your
wealth, for charity well bestowed upon the poor is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
regarded as given to Him who is worthy to receive
riches; of your refinement, for sweetness of expression
and kindliness can reach the hearts of the vile, and
produce a first emotion of love to the Lord you copy;
of your prayerfulness, for it must be well pleasing to
Him, who paid the full ransom for every soul, to have
those who are "afar off" brought by your pleadings
within the influences of sovereign grace!</p>

<p class="cap_5">"PIONEERS are required in my parish," said
the Rector to the Missionary, at the time of
his appointment. "In these densely populated
parts of London the people have outgrown
the influence of the Church. I, for
instance, have upwards of 16,000 poor, and
very few of the better classes. Not twenty of these
poor attend church, and the dissenters draw very few.
The sad truth is, that through neglect of religious duties
the people are fast losing the knowledge of God; and
their close contact with the depraved and criminal,
is demoralizing them with the leaven of wickedness.
Several of my curates have attempted to grapple with
the evil, but its magnitude has overpowered us. In
addition to over-crowding, the migratory habits of the
people increase the difficulty. I am assured that in
several of the streets the inhabitants are changed once
or twice a year, and in the courts there are often
monthly changes in the rooms. As soon therefore as
good is done some of the people leave, and fresh comers
require the work to be done over again. This difficulty
can only be met by an order of men with special qualifications
for the work, and sufficiently numerous to cover<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
all the bad neighbourhoods; so that the people wherever
they move to may be brought under Christian
influences. Your society has an aggressive element of
simple Christianity, which is calculated to accomplish
this, and to keep your agents down to their work, and I
therefore give you a hearty welcome, and the assurance
of my sympathy in your labours."</p>
</div>

<p>The Pioneer soon found that the Rector's statements
as regards the moving habits of the people were correct.
After short intervals between visits he frequently found
persons in whom he had become interested gone, and
not a trace of them remaining, their places being occupied
by others. This was the case one afternoon in a
house round the corner,&mdash;one of the houses included in
the block, and which we for weighty reasons have regarded
as part of the Court. The visitor was walking
upstairs, when he met a new arrival of so strange a type
that he was arrested as by an apparition. It was
evidently a little girl of meagre form and aged expression
of countenance, but here the likeness to our species
grew doubtful. Her ethnology was not clearly developed
as she stood with bare shoulders of raven blackness, her
lank light hair being tied up in a bunch with pieces of
rag, while the face and hands were of a yellowish, dirty
hue. The object was startled at meeting the stranger,
and was about to retreat, when he stopped her by asking
a question. She answered in a sharp, precocious manner,
and the following dialogue took place.</p>

<p>"My good child, who are you?"</p>

<p>"Black Poll: that me. And I goes to the gaff, and I
does the changes, and jumps 'Jim Crow;' and when I
ain't black I sings 'Charming Judy O'Calligan.' That
me!"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span></p>

<p>"Do your father and mother live here?"</p>

<p>"What a stunner! cos I ain't got no mother: she died
of cholera. Dusty, what does the bones, is my uncle.
He took me out of the workus, and I earns him lots,&mdash;ten
shills a week."</p>

<p>"How many of you are there?"</p>

<p>"Oh, a lot! We ain't together. Billy Mutton is our
guv'nor; and Dusty has took that ere sky-parlour, and
they all comes here to be blacked up."</p>

<p>The Missionary approached the door indicated, and
of necessity gave a loud knock, as men were conversing
inside. To the inquiry, "What are you thumping there
for?" he opened the door and stepped in. The man
who confronted him was of short stature, and of the
most dismal of black complexions. His attire was of
light tweed, with broad green stripes. Upon his knee
rested a fiddle, and its stick was in his right hand ready
for practice. The table was placed near the window,
and in addition to its other uses it evidently served for
purposes of the toilet. Two cheap looking-glasses were
upon it, and two tallow candles, placed in bottles, were
burning, though it was full daylight. The men were
evidently burning pieces of cork, adding tallow and a
black powder, and then rubbing the precious composition
over their hands and faces. Two of the men had
completed the beautifying process, and one of them was
tying on an immense white handkerchief, while the
other with an adhesive composition was fixing a nasal
organ of extraordinary shape and proportion. All this
was seen while the stranger was making his office
known, though but few words were necessary, as the
tracts in his hand indicated his business. It was evident
that the man with the fiddle understood him, as he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
without delay commenced playing "Drops of Brandy,"
and continued a medley of comic tunes, ogling his eyes
and gesticulating in a humorous manner. He received
occasional assistance from his companions, who struck
up choruses or attitudinized with mirthful effect. Judging
from his hearty laugh the stranger fully appreciated
their efforts, and instead of leaving, as they no doubt
expected, took a seat. Before the last scrape of the
fiddle had died away he remarked coolly, "That's more
than I could do, because I have not your ability. Why,
were I to attempt a tune upon that fiddle, I should
make such a discord as to startle and perhaps drive you
all out of the room. The day is however coming when
I shall hope to be a musician."</p>

<p>To an expression of inquiry the speaker produced his
pocket Bible, and observed: "You may not know it,
but very much in this Book was written for and has
been set to music, and the song I mean to sing is here,
and something about the instrument I hope to play.
Now there are instruments mentioned here which you
could never play, and some which you have not even
heard of, such as the sackbut and dulcimer; but you all
know the harp?"</p>

<p>"I can play it a bit," exclaimed a man at the glass.</p>

<p>"That's the instrument," continued the stranger;
"and all Christians will play it when they get to
heaven, for it is written here, 'And I heard the voice of
harpers harping with their harps: and they sang as it
were a new song,' and the singers were '<i>redeemed</i> from
the earth.'" The meaning of the beautiful word "redemption"
was then explained to them, and their attention
directed to the Redeemer.</p>

<p>As the child entered to have her toilet completed the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
speaker said, "I will tell you more about that another
time. I really came in to ask you about this child.
She looks ill and overdone with work. I suppose that
she stays until very late at the gaff?" The man with
the bones, who had mounted a naval cocked-hat, replied,
"I took her out of the workus, guv'nor, to make
a woman on her; but bless yer, her woice has gone, and
she can't keep up with her clump shoes for twenty
minutes; and as we are a-going werry soon to the seaside,
we means to leave her with Mother Dell, down the
Court."</p>

<p>The men were startled as the Missionary inquired
sternly, "Do you men believe that there is a God in
heaven?"</p>

<p>Upon several answering "Yes!" he continued: "He
is the great Father of us all, and it is not His will
that even this little one should perish. You know that
that woman is vile and drunken, and has juvenile
thieves and depraved people in her house, and yet you
would expose this poor child to a life of crime. This
shall not be, as I will take her, in the name of the
Redeemer, and place her in a home."</p>

<p>"Glad to get rid on her," was the heartless reply.
But as the Missionary left, a dissipated-looking man,
who had partly completed the blacking process, sprung
from his glass, and following him to the stairs, said with
emotion, "Thank you sir. I am a wicked backslider;
but do take care of poor little Polly." This request was
accompanied with a grasp of the hand which left a
mark so black that hard washing was required to erase
the stain; that however did not matter, as it was the
grasp of gratitude.</p>

<p>Next morning a lady and the Missionary entered the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
niggers' room. The child, whose complexion had by
scrubbing been reduced from black to a whitey-brown,
looked worn and ill; but her eyes brightened as the
lady took hold of her little hand, and said, "If you are
good in the new home, I will always be kind to you."
The act of condescension, and the sweet tone of that
educated voice, had its influence with the niggers, for
they murmured their thanks, and gave the child an
affectionate farewell; Dusty's voice being the last heard
from the top of the stairs, exhorting her to "be a good
un, and a credit to yer uncle."</p>

<p>That afternoon another kindness was done, though
only in the way of good advice, for a daughter of the
Court. Her parents were old inhabitants, they had
lived there for many years, and sustained the respectability
of the costermonger's calling.</p>

<p>"Should like to have a say with you, mister, if you
ain't a-going," said the head of the family to the
Missionary, as he was leaving the place; and when with
the good wife they were seated in the little parlour,
surrounded with partly decayed vegetables, he continued
as follows: "You know my Bess: as good a girl
as ever was, she is, and a fortune to any coster what
gets her. Why she took to the trade quite natural like.
When only as high as them baskets we sent her out
with cat's meat, and she did wonderful. Such a girl to
cut up a piece of horseflesh never was; and then you
should have seen how she skewered it! Why she made
lots of it, and all of them thought they had thumping
hap'orths; howsomever the cats all got their bones
through their furs, and then they diskivered what a
girl our Bess was."</p>

<p>After a pause for consideration he proceeded. "May<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
be you doesn't know Tom, who sold lots of cowcumbers
last summer and put a sov in the bank, as he doesn't put
his hand to his mouth unnecessary, as he's teetotal.
His father and I has known each other always, cos we
was both born in Short's Court, Whitechapel, which was
a curious circumstance, and we always has a pint when
we meets. Now his Tom has a new silk round his neck,
and looks handsome, as he always is. So he gets near
my barrow when Bess is there, and helps her knock
off trade quick, and he pushes home hisself. Well on
Sunday he comes the swell, and wanted to walk Bess
out, and says he to me, 'My father's a coming to have
a pint with you over this job, as you was both born in
that ere Court; and I wouldn't let your Bess push that
ere barrow, cos I've three sovs, and I'd buy her a pretty
donkey. That's me. And I wants Bess to be my lawful
wedded wife.'" Here he looked at the mother, who
was in tears, and inquired, "What would you do,
master, if you was us?"</p>

<p>The visitor felt the importance of his position, and at
once rose to the dignity of the friend of the family: for
what can be a greater proof of friendship than to be
consulted about matrimonial alliances, their settlements
and prospects?</p>

<p>As arranged, the parties concerned met the following
Sunday afternoon for consultation, and to receive the
advice of their friend. He however found upon his
arrival that other considerations than his advice had
settled the business. The elders of Short's Court had
agreed to cement a life-long friendship by becoming
relations. The mothers were in close consultation about
the new home to be established in the Place; and as for
the young people, they were in an ecstatic state of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
mutual admiration. Her affection to her parents and
high costermongering qualities had been enlarged upon
to Tom's delight, and his sobriety and promise of the
donkey had filled her cup of happiness to the brim.
There was only one difficulty, and Tom considered it a
real one, for he said gravely, "How is the banns to be
got up? for it looks so for a coster to go into a church
to speak to the parson."</p>

<p>"The clergyman is coming down with me during the
week," said the Missionary, "as he wishes to know you
all: and I will bring him in here; and if you like to
invite me I will attend the wedding." A hearty welcome,
words of Christian counsel, and much shaking of
hands followed, and then the affianced and their friends
were left as happy as princes and nobles are supposed
to be on such occasions.</p>

<p>For three Sundays the banns were read and the free
seats occupied with awkward worshippers, as a wedding
was a strange event in the Court, and not a few of its
inhabitants went to hear "Bess asked;" and then the
third Monday, like all appointed days, arrived quickly,
and brought excitement and joy into the Place. A
party of East-end barrow-men arrived early, and for that
day fraternized with the costers of the West, and young
urchins were quarrelling over sundry old tin kettles and
saucepans, which they had provided for the rough music
of the evening. The doors and windows were thronged,
and a crowd was waiting at the end of the Place to accompany
the bride to church. At length a shout was
raised, and the bride stepped forth, leaning upon the
arm of the bridegroom. Her light cotton dress, pink
shawl, and white cotton gloves, were admired by all;
while the blue bonnet, with large red rose and white<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
strings, was the envy as well as the admiration of the
female portion of the crowd. The bridegroom was
sensibly dressed in a new business suit, his happy face
being surmounted with a beaver which the trade pronounced
to be "nobby." The relations followed in a
group behind, a mob bringing up the rear.</p>

<p>Those who entered the church were reverential during
the solemnity, the officiating minister was most kind to
the bridal party, the happy pair made their marks in
the register, the clerk filled in particulars, and the party
left the church; the Missionary joined the group, and
all marched back to the Court as merry as wedding
bells. The widow, like another Martha, had been busy
about many things, as the saveloys, shrimps, cake, and
coffee were all ready, and she received the bride with a
kiss of motherly affection. The simple breakfast was
soon over, and their friend then opened his Bible and
read about the marriage in Cana of Galilee, spoke kindly
to the young people about dedication to God being the
secret of a happy married life, and he then commended
them in prayer to the blessing of the Almighty.</p>

<p>Thus ended the wedding; but its influence was felt
among the people, and from that time a higher moral
tone was developed. Family secrets indeed were discovered,
and the kind Rector often remitted fees, as a
proof of his interest in the people, that none should
wilfully live in transgression. On one morning alone
the lay agent gave away three wives, and this led to the
baptism of an aged woman and six children. The woman
rented one of the houses, and went to the marriage
of her lodger; she had attended the little mission meeting,
and had become anxious about her salvation;
without telling the cause, she had suffered deep spiritual<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
distress. Upon leaving the church she expressed desire
to speak to the clergyman, and upon being taken into
the vestry told him that "she had not been baptized, as
her parents lived in Holborn Rents, and did not care
about religion; that she passed as a widow, and had
grown-up children, but had not been married, which now
made her miserable." She was exhorted to repent truly,
and promised that upon expressing repentance towards
God, and faith in the Lord Jesus Christ, she should be
baptized.</p>

<p>About a month after, a scene of solemn interest took
place at the font. The Rector, who was himself nearly
seventy, placed the water of baptism upon the brow of
the woman of seventy-five years, the young Missionary
pronouncing her name. That evening a prayer-meeting
was held in the Court, to seek a blessing upon the newly
baptized, and the attendance was very large; unlikely
persons were there, including two of the translators, the
woman of the dogs, and a rough. The passage itself
was crowded, and to those who engaged in prayer there
were indications of spiritual blessing,&mdash;of an aroused
state of feeling, as though the voice had said, "Come
from the four winds, O breath, and breathe upon these
slain, that they may live." The hymn, "There is a
fountain filled with blood," was sung, and the fifth
chapter of the 2nd Corinthians read. The Evangelist
then spoke simply and clearly of judgment and of mercy,
and besought his hearers to be reconciled to God.</p>

<p>After the meeting several remained behind to be
prayed with. One of these was a fishwoman of hard
features and vile tongue. She was quite forty years of
age, and had removed into the Place from a neighbouring
street which had no thoroughfare, and was called by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
the people "Little Hell." Bad as the inhabitants in the
Court were, they conceived a dislike to this woman,
which made her life uncomfortable. She was indeed
hateful to many. When addressed kindly at her door,
and told of "goodness and mercy," she was subdued at
once; and communicated the secret of her debased
condition. She said, "I was a pretty little village girl,
and when I comed up to London I got hawful wicked,
and now I am obleged to be a fish-fag: and you make
me think of the parson lady as made us kneel along the
church and say them prayers." It was plain that the
good impressions made in the village church so many
years before were being revived, and she was invited to
the meeting, and that with blessed result.</p>

<p>Proof was also given that the blessing was not transient
but real, and the minister of the neighbouring
Baptist chapel became deeply interested in the Place.
When the Missionary, at his request, called upon him,
he said, "I am glad to know and to encourage you
in the Lord's work; and then I want to speak to you
about an old man. You may have heard that twice a
week I have temperance meetings under my chapel.
For some time past this old man has been constant in
his attendance, and I am told that he has for years been
a pest in the neighbourhood, and is called Drunken
Sammy. When invited he signed the pledge, and since
then some of my people have got him to attend the
services. One Sunday I sent for him into the vestry,
and he spoke of you and a widow as his friends, and of
his promise to keep sober. He is evidently under deep
religious convictions, and as he is very shy I have told
the pew opener to keep a seat for him near the door.
Of this I am convinced, that he will not break the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
pledge, as he speaks with anger of the cursed drink.
Besides him, two women out of the same place are
usually at chapel, and say that 'the man who reads the
Bible has made them feel that they are not Christians,
and that they want to be happy;' so we are getting
them here to a week-night service."</p>

<p>This was pleasant but not strange news, because the
Missionary knew that the acting of conscience, enlightened
by the Word of God and the emotions of
the new life, were felt by many; and that as the result,
they were pressing into the various churches and chapels.
The work indeed became overpowering; and it was impossible
for him to speak with all who now desired his
visits, as many in their distress kept him a long time.
Strength equal to the day was however given; and
almost nightly meetings in the widow's room made up
for lost visits.</p>

<p>Among those who received marked benefit was the
sewerman, who occupied a back "parlour" for his family
and the yard for rats which he caught in the "shores"
(sewers) and brought home in a bag attached to the
inside of his coat. The smell of rats was always strong
upon him, and as he had a blinking peering look he was
far from popular with his neighbours. When, however,
in his earnestness to hear, he pressed forward into the
meeting room, several smiled pleasure at seeing him,
and he was motioned to a seat. After this he was
constant in his attendance, and a gradual change of
appearance was noticed. That he washed himself in
right good earnest was evident, and the lighting up of
his countenance, with effort to join in the singing,
proved that his soul also was stirred by the glad and
to him new tidings of the Saviour's mercy. He avoided<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
conversation upon his spiritual state, as he knew not
how to express his feelings, and nothing could induce
him to attend with respectable people at public worship
(he may have considered himself offensive), but he got
to love the little meeting, and it became evident that he
had attained to peace in believing.</p>

<p>To the Missionary and his helpers this was a time for
rejoicing; but they had also their discouragements and
anxieties. A folded letter, for instance, of strange
shape, and bearing the impression, "Dartmoor Convict
Establishment," was delivered at one of the meetings;
and upon opening it the following printed instructions
met the eye: "In writing to the convict, direct to No.
2484 (<i>a.</i> 1, 2)." This was evidently the number of the
young thief whose companion had asked the Missionary
to reform him upon his first visit to the Court, on the
ground of his being "unlucky." That effort had been
made in earnest; for the mother and the Missionary
upon the next discharge morning took their stand at
the iron-barred gate of Coldbath Field's prison, and
waited until the heavy lock was opened and the ponderous
bolt withdrawn. Then the jail-birds issued out
helter-skelter, looking well, and rejoicing in their liberty
as if bent on pleasure. Some were received by their
"pals," unmistakable members of the criminal class, and
were conducted in a sort of triumph to their former
dens, with the prospect of a little wild pleasure, another
crime, and then a longer term of imprisonment. Our
bird, a sharp-looking, well grown youth of seventeen
years, was seized by his mother, and hastily informed
"that this ere gent had come to reform him." A keen
glance at the reformer and a movement of the eyelid,
understood by such people as "the knowing wink," expressed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
his reluctance to undergo the process. He then,
in a surly way, said to his mother, "I wants some bacca
and some beer: that's what I wants; and I'll have it!"
As he glanced at a group of persons who had hurried
from the prison-gate to the public-house, the mother
evidently felt that the required refreshment was the only
means of keeping her son. She therefore whispered to
her friend, "He'll bolt, yer honour; so I'll treat him,
and then he will be a lamb, the dear will!" And then
they also passed over to the public-house, leaving the
reformer outside, and in a perplexity as to what he
ought to do. The long walk with that strange-looking
woman had been almost a punishment, for everybody
turned round to look at her. She noticed the annoyance,
and volunteered this explanation: "You see, yer
honour, I must wear this ere large cap, as I should get
rheumatics in my poor head; and it's now seventeen
years since I ever wore a bonnet or shawl, cos of my
oath. My husband was a good chap to me, and had
only once got into trouble. Well, he went out with a
fool what peached, and they lifted a lot of bonnets and
a box of the beautifulest shawls as ever was; and he
was collared in the place where they was, and he got
fourteen years over the sea. I then goes down on my
knees, and swears that I would never wear bonnet or
shawl till he come back. He never saw our Eddy, as
he was born the week after he had gone, and he died
very soon at Van Diemen's; and I tried to bring up
Eddy respectable like, but he's like his poor father.
Now if people tells you that I receives, tell them that
they lies; cos I lives honest, and does pawning for
women what has got modesty, and doesn't like to be
seen going to their Uncle's; and then I gets more on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
anything, and picks up what I can: but I'm an honest
woman!"</p>

<p>This "honest woman" and her son only remained
a few minutes in the public-house; and as they came
toward him, the heart of the Missionary yearned for
their salvation. That fine youthful countenance had
already the lines of viciousness upon it; and he was not
improved by the short cut hair and the long pipe he
was smoking. Poor fellow, he was but one of thousands
of the youth of this great city who are as much brought
up to live lives of crime as heathen children who are
taught to pray to gods of wood and stone. Now it
surely must be true that Christian sympathy has power
to penetrate the souls of the depraved: for as the three
pursued their homeward journey there was between them
confidence and good fellowship; and though the would-be
reformer was disappointed, he felt that an influence
had been gained over the depraved youth.</p>

<p>The offer of a refuge was refused, but the young thief
promised to attend a class at the Ragged School which
the Missionary was forming, and in which he himself
intended to teach. He did attend, with eight other unruly
natives of the Court, and received instruction so
readily, and made such progress, that hope was entertained
of his reformation. He obtained work at the
side of the Canal, to unload boats, and had kept to it
for several weeks, when a circumstance occurred which
crushed his high spirit. The members of a gang of
"Sneaks and Mudlarks," with which he had been associated,
were annoyed at his forsaking their company.
Several of these one day crossed over the bridge and
saw him at work. They called to the other workmen,
and told them "that that fellow was a known thief, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
had had four months on the mill." That evening the
foreman made inquiries of the police, and in the morning
when the poor youth went to work he was spurned from
the gate. The mother incited him to take vengeance,
and he severely beat two of the youths who, as he said,
had ruined him.</p>

<p>When the friend and teacher heard of his trouble he
called to see him, and the youth opened the door; but
instead of speaking he ran upstairs. He was followed:
but he vanished at the upper landing. As he absented
himself from the class, other efforts to reach him were
made, but he always disappeared at the top of the stairs.
One afternoon the teacher saw his pupil enter the house,
and followed him in. He sprang forward, his friend
after him, and as he disappeared the teacher thought
that he heard the trap-door of the roof close down. He
at once placed his right foot upon the old handrail, and
pushing the trap-door open sprang out upon the roof of
the house; and there, before the chimney-stack, beside
his pigeon-house, sat the vanished one. He looked unhappy,
but joined in a hearty laugh as the Missionary
took his seat between the next pair of chimney pots.
The novelty of their position was soon forgotten as the
poor lad spoke of his persecutions and troubles. The
pocket Bible was produced, and the narrative was read
of Peter praying upon the house-top, and his seeing the
vision of a great sheet, knit at the four corners, let down
from heaven, containing all manner of four-footed beasts
of the earth. From the words, "God has showed me
that I should not call any man common or unclean," the
Gospel was made plain to him, and the ease with which
grace enables us to resist temptation and to bear troubles.
Tears started into the eyes of the poor youth,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">&nbsp;</a></span>
as he said, almost in a whisper, "I ortent to have done
it, sir; but I thinks that I am done for now. I was a
fool to bolt from you." And then he glanced along the
roof so anxiously, that a detective would have suspected
a thief's trail to another trap-door. An angry voice
called a "lazy varmint" to come to tea, and then the
trap opened and the Missionary made his descent. He
was received by the strange mother with a scream of
surprise, and the announcement "that it was dreadful to
see him a-coming down there."</p>

<span class="caption">&quot;He sprang out upon the roof of the house, and there, before the chimney stack, beside

</div>

<p>That call to tea was the last which the convict's widow
gave to her son. In the midst of it stealthy steps were
heard upon the stairs, but the youth made no effort to
escape. Two policemen in plain clothes entered the
room, and one of them, seizing him by the arm, said,
"We want you upon a charge of burglary, with violence
to the person, committed last night at Hampstead."
The prisoner burst into tears, and his mother, throwing
her arms around him, gave a deep cry of anguish. There
was but short delay, for he was hurried down stairs, and
on to the station. Next morning he appeared in the
dock at the police court, and a clear case was made out
against him. His companions were taken upon the spot,
and though he escaped, his face had been seen by the
police and two other persons. At his trial he pleaded
guilty, and his companions, who were well-known thieves,
were sentenced to ten years' transportation, and himself
to seven. His teacher visited him at the House of Detention,
and then in the cell at Newgate. He appeared to
be truly penitent, and promised to send him his first
letter; and this accounts for the epistle from the convict
establishment. When the Missionary read it to the
wretched mother, she acknowledged that her sins had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
separated her from her God, her husband, and her son;
and then, for the first time, she knelt down, and sobbed
again while Divine mercy was implored on her behalf.
There is some hope in her case and for her son also,
as the Chaplain wrote a private note to the Missionary,
asking for particulars concerning the convict, and telling
him that the prisoner showed contrition, and spoke with
feeling about a conversation upon the house-top. We
must therefore leave convict 2484 (<i>a.</i> 1, 2), to endure the
penalty of his crime, and show what kindness we can to
his mother.</p>

<div class="drop">
<img src="images/idrop_i.jpg" alt="I" width="60" height="113" class="cap" />
<p class="cap_2">IF the crew of a man of war may be regarded
as a "little world," the densely-packed
hundreds of our Court could certainly
claim the same distinction. In
addition to the miserable shelter which
conferred upon them the few joys of home
and the associations of their life-struggles, there
were many links to the large outer world. All, without
exception, had to do battle with keen, cold poverty;
and in the morning as they left their dwellings it was
amusing to contemplate the nature of their various
pursuits, as fifty-six different callings were professed by
them. The costermongers might be seen pushing out
their barrows of vegetables, fruit, and coarse fish. The
hucksters and the itinerant herbalist with their boxes.
The sweep with his machine, and the Punch and Judy
man with his show upon his shoulders, and red-coated
dog Toby at his heels. Professed beggars, confirmed
thieves, and the fortune-telling women, left at more
genteel hours; while the workers with the needle, both
men and women, might at all times be seen hurrying
off to shops with the work they had accomplished in
"poverty, hunger, and dirt." And then, strange as it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
may seem, there were inhabitants in that obscure place
which linked it to the upper classes. In a first-floor
front lived two aged women, one of them a lady of
eighty-four years. Though very feeble and careless as
regarded present comforts, she had a vivid recollection
of persons and of events connected with the beginning
of the century. She was the daughter of a physician,
and had been governess to the children of a Duke, and
received a pension of 30 a year, which was her living.
Her delight was to untie bundles of letters with crested
seals and arms upon them, to show the autographs, and
to relate anecdotes of her great friends who had long
passed away, but several of whose names live in their
country's records. Her companion was the widow of a
mechanic, with an allowance from the parish. She
always treated the lady with respect, and a close friendship
had for many years existed between them. In
death they were scarcely divided, as she only survived
the lady for a few weeks.</p>
</div>

<p>The blackleg who for some months shared a room
with two news-boys, had the unmistakable bearing of a
gentleman, and though a master of slang he could not
divest his tongue of its College culture. At a time of
compunction he told the visitor that he was the brother
of a Baronet, but that dissipation and gambling had
reduced him to want bread. "I bear an alias," he continued,
"that the family name may not be disgraced,
but I will never humble myself to relations. I am now
out of luck, and have to act as billiard-marker in a low
flash house, but I have nicely hedged my book for the
Derby, and if fortune smiles I shall have sufficient cash
to establish myself in Canada, where I may rise to my
proper position." At the time of the Derby he was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
absent from his lodgings for a week; one morning he
returned well dressed, paid up his lodging, gave the
news-boys ten shillings each, as "nest eggs" for the
savings-bank, left a note for the Missionary, expressing
his sincere thanks for his kind interest in him; and after
that was not heard of again.</p>

<p>In our little world there were also those who had
defined religious and political opinions, and the people
were not always free from the excitement which on
some subjects disturbs the outer world. There were
barber's shop and taproom politicians, as well as "anti-theologians,"
and several, who through ignorance of the
truth, were the victims of superstition. The great body
of the men were of Republican and Communist opinions,
and belonged to what are justly called "the dangerous
classes," while the principles of pure and undefiled
religion were only beginning to exert their influence
in forming public opinion in our Court. Just at this
time new occupants entered the back parlour of No. 11,
and a short account of them and their proceedings will
help to show the mind of the people.</p>

<p>The family consisted of an Irishwoman and her two
sons. She was employed at a Roman Catholic Chapel,
and her two sons served at the altar. At home they
showed their devotion by placing a miniature altar upon
a table opposite their door, which was usually open. It
was prettily arranged, with its sacred place high in the
centre, and its covering of silk with finely wrought cross
and sprigs of flowers. On one side was a little font-like
vessel containing holy water, and on the other an image
of "the Virgin," with a bunch of artificial flowers at
her feet. At times the room was darkened and several
small candles were lit upon the altar. The effect was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
striking, and as the lodgers passed they looked with a
kind of awe at the woman and her sons when prostrate
before it. As other Romanists went into the room to
perform their devotions, and as they commenced circulating
little books, the family became a trial to the
Missionary. The enemy was sowing tares, but a circumstance
occurred which neutralized the bad influence.</p>

<p>If this was an effort at proselytism, they fixed upon
a bad position for the purpose, as the next room was
occupied by a young man who styled himself a "positive
religionist." He was a shoemaker, but by self-culture
had educated himself above his fellows. He was well
read in infidel literature, and being of a reflective, philosophical
order of mind, had worked out a system of
opposition to Divine revelation. The infidels of the
neighbourhood regarded him as their "coming man,"
and his fame was spreading, as he was clever in argument
and powerful in debate. The Missionary, upon
his first visit, felt so powerless in meeting his objections,
that he commenced a course of reading, with the
one object of leading him into the way of truth. This
man became interested in the religious observances of
the lodgers in the next room, and often conversed with
them. One morning the youth opened the sacred
place, and taking out a sacramental "wafer," told the
infidel that he had brought it from the chapel; that
it was only a wafer then, but that if a priest pronounced
the words of consecration over it, it would
immediately be changed into the Lord Jesus Christ.
To confirm this he gave him a catechism containing
the Creed of Pius IV., and pointed out the words, "In
this Sacrament are contained not only the true body
of Christ, and all the constituents of a true body, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
<i>bones</i> and <i>sinews</i>, but also <i>Christ whole and entire</i>." The
infidel read this, and again asked to see the wonderful
wafer. As the youth held it in his palm, the infidel
struck the under part of the hand, and caught the wafer
as it fell. It was broken into several pieces, but he
rushed into his room, and pasted it together upon a
piece of brown paper.</p>

<p>About ten days after, the visitor noticed several of
the Irish residents and the youth in an excited conversation.
Upon inquiring the cause, they told him that
the young man had taken the blessed wafer round to
infidel meetings, where they had made fun of and pretended
to pray to it. "Och, an' shure," exclaimed a
labourer, "an' his riverence never altered it at all, at all;
but howan'iver he says 'twas took by Mick, and 'twasn't
given, and it's himself to do penance!" And then he
declared with a bitter oath, that he would take it back
to the priest. As the man had a pick in his hand, and
raised it in a threatening manner, and a crowd, chiefly of
his own countrymen, were assembling, the Missionary
felt it to be his duty to act as peacemaker, and therefore
exclaimed with a smile, "Try reason before the
shillelagh: the youth and one of you had better go with
me and ask them to give it back to him!" This was
agreed to, and they made their way to the room of the
six "translators," to which place the young man had fled
with his prize when he saw the storm brewing. The
men had pinned the wafer to the wall, and a filthy
object it looked. They were evidently prepared to defend
it, but were embarrassed by the presence of the Missionary,
who addressing the young man, said, "I heard you
called a thief; now as positive morality is a part of
positive religion, I have come to ask you to restore the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
stolen wafer." "Not I!" he replied, with a merry
laugh, in which his companions joined. "I shall rather
try and find a priest, and get him to conjure it into the
Man of Nazareth, to the benefit of my paste as well as
the dough, and then we shall look upon and pray to&mdash;"
Here, with profane words, he uttered that name which
is high above every name that is named in heaven and
in earth. A shout of derision from the group of infidels
was silenced by the visitor, who said firmly, "This is
really bad of you, to defend an immoral act by an outrage
upon my feelings. That wafer is not, and never can
become the Saviour of the world. To believe that, is
no part of the Christian religion, that belief is a horrid
corruption added to the Christian system. Listen while
I read from this book, the standard of Christian faith,
Christ's institution of His holy sacrament, which the
wafer-god profanes: 'The Lord Jesus, the same night in
which He was betrayed, took bread; and when He had
given thanks, He brake it, and said, Take, eat: this is My
body, which is broken for you: this do in remembrance of
Me. After the same manner He took the cup, when He
had supped, saying, This cup is the new testament in My
blood: this do ye, as oft as ye drink it, in remembrance
of Me; for as oft as ye eat this bread and drink this cup,
ye do show the Lord's death till He come.'" And then,
raising his voice, the reader said, "Be it known to you
that the perpetuity of this sacrament is one of the
many external evidences which support a truth in
which each of you has a present and eternal interest;
that the Lord Jesus, after accomplishing death for your
salvation, rose from the dead, and is now alive, and
is seated at God's right hand, a Prince and a Saviour."
As he ceased speaking the infidels conferred among<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
themselves; and then the young man unpinned the
wafer from the wall, and handing it to the youth, said,
"There, take it back, as it ain't moral for us to keep it,
though it's not worth so much as one of our bristles, of
which we get a lot for a penny; but we never take one
without asking each other for it." The youth seized
the dirty object, and, with his friend, hurried downstairs,
while the reader stood with the sword of the Spirit in
his hand, ready to do conflict with the King's enemies.</p>

<p>Poor wafer! but for the accident of a youth taking
thee instead of another, thou wouldest have been the
object of an imposing ceremonial: placed upon a high
altar and surrounded by lighted candles, before thee
incense would have been burned, and priests in gorgeous
raiment would have prostrated themselves, while
a congregation of worshippers would have adored thee
as the Lord who had redeemed them. Instead of this,
thou wast the cause of His blessed name being blasphemed,
and, as the embodiment of a lie, made to hinder
the salvation of wicked men.</p>

<p>From the time the miniature altar was set up, it was
noticed that two Sisters of Mercy, with their dismal
clothing and large baskets, frequently made their appearance
in the Court, and the Widow observed three
children of a poor English family, who lived in the house,
returning from the convent school with the Irish children.
Upon speaking to the mother upon the subject, she
said, that "the Sisters came in to see her and gave her
nice things, and asked her to send the children to their
school; and, as one religion was as good as another, she
should do as she liked." The children, when spoken to
about their school, repeated a prayer which they said
they "had been taught to say to a great dolly with a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
baby in its arms." Upon hearing this, the Missionary
decided upon speaking to the father upon the matter,
and in the evening went for that purpose.</p>

<p>This man was an "animated sandwich," and as he
shuffled into the Court with his worn out shoes and
crushed hat, clothing to match being partly concealed
by boards covered with flaming placards, he appeared
a deplorable object. His haggard, careworn expression
of face led one to believe his saying, that "he was a
chap as had been smashed up." Little did he think,
as the Missionary followed him upstairs, that he had
been the subject of much thought, and that the visitor
he welcomed was as desirous for his favour as though
he had been one of the great of the earth. The poor
man was in a communicative state of mind, and in
reply to inquiries respecting his health and business
prospects, made the following statement.</p>

<p>"You see, master, as how sandwiches never can get
on, cos we're a broke-down lot. Why you should see
us afore we starts with our boards, all a-rubbin' our
rheumatisms or a-coughin', so as it is wonderful how we
gets on. But lots of us are respectable though we ain't
always honest, as we get into a public instead of crawling,
and there we enjoys our pipes and talks. Why
one on us is a queer old man what had a good business
in the muffin line, and it udd make you stare if you
heard the poetry he makes up, and then you would
laugh, and then your eyes would water like. Well, to-day
he brings in a new song all by hisself, and it all
ends with what is called&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><span class="i0">"'The man what walks the gutters.'</span>
</div>

<p>"And it's a correct account of how we are looked down<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
on, and shows that none of our old pals will shake our
paws, as it's awkward like when your harms pop out of
your side like serampores at the railway; and then it
shows that it's no good to police the men what gets
drunk, and fine 'em five shillings, the correct thing
being to make 'em sandwiches for a week with 'vertisements
about them teetotal meetings. And then nobs
would mayhaps have to do the boards, which would
helewate the perfession, as all what they does helewates.
Howsomever a chap what's a wagabon offered me his
fist, and I kicked his shins; and affor that I never killed
a fly, as my 'art is tender-like. That wagabon ruined us.
My wife was a 'ousemaid, and I was a cabby; and she
had twenty-three sovereigns, and I had ten on 'em.
So we made a match, and I took a stable and borrowed
a 'orse, and bought an old cab and did it up, and we
was a-doing first-rate. So that man comes one morning,
and says he to me, 'You're good natured, and if
you'll oblige me, I will oblige you; and I wants to
buy a 'orse, and if you'll write across a paper what's a
bill, I'll have the money and will stand treat.' Well,
that made me feel as I was a gent to get money with
writing, and I does it; and the treat I had wasn't no
good. Well, three months arter that, a chap comes to
my stable with a paper nearly all print, which said I
was to pay that fifteen pounds I signed on the paper;
and I couldn't and I wouldn't, and I got drunk lots of
times, and they hexecuted in the stable, and then I
hadn't a cab; and then I frets, and was werry ill in the
hospital; and then I thought a lot, and says I to myself,
says I, 'I ortent to have writ on that paper, and I
ortent to have took to the drink, and I ortent to have
been 'ard with the wife, as I made the trouble. And<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
now I'm a sandwich I brings her the little bit of money
I gets."</p>

<p>"You did wrong," said the Missionary, "in signing
that paper without consulting your wife and your Bible.
She might have seen the danger and prevented it; if not
the good Book would have said to you, 'Be not thou
one of them that strike hands, or of them that are
sureties for debts. If thou hast nothing to pay, why
should he take away thy bed from under thee?' I have
called in because I find that you are making another
mistake, a very serious one, as regards your children, by
allowing them to go to the convent school. The Sisters
have been kind to your wife, and have persuaded her
that there is no difference between their religion and that
which is true; they have however caused your children
to kneel before images, though God in the commandment
has said, 'Thou shalt not make unto thee any
graven image, or bow down thyself to them.' Besides
this, they will be taught other things which are not
true, and must therefore injure them. Poor as you are,
you are responsible to God for your children, and you
sin by allowing them to be brought up in a false
religion. Bear bravely with your troubles, and brighter
days may come, but do right to your children by allowing
me to take them to a proper school." After a
feeble resistance from the mother this was agreed to,
and the visit ended in a reading from the Bible; after
which the family knelt together at the throne of grace.
Next morning the Missionary called for the children
and took them to the National School. During the day
the Sisters called upon the mother, and after a short
visit left the Court with a quick tread. The week after,
several of the Romanists, including the family with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
miniature altar, left; eleven of the catechisms they had
circulated were exchanged for good books, and so the
effort to Romanize in Paradise Court was stayed.</p>

<p>The opposite house, the door of which was closed
upon the Missionary at his first visit, was known to
leading members of the cadging fraternity as an "easy
padding ken," which means "a quiet lodging-house for
begging impostors." As these rogues only stayed a
short time, to conceal themselves from the police or to
prepare new deceits for their country friends, a rapid
succession of them was met with, from the "shallow
cove" (<i>i.e.</i>, a pretended sailor in distress), to the "highflier"
(<i>i.e.</i>, a begging-letter impostor). The gipsy man
and his wife who kept the den professed to be very fond
of the tracts, but a man who did the "religious dodge"
told the giver that they were saved up and sold to such
as himself at twopence a dozen, for village and roadside
begging. The landlord got into trouble with the
police, and to put them off the scent he for several
months let the upper rooms in the regular way. This
accounts for the circumstance that the visitor did not
know that the top back had been occupied by a family
for five or six weeks. Thinking that lodgers were there,
he, one dark November afternoon, made his way to that
part of the house. In reply to his knock, the door was
opened by a woman who was partly intoxicated, and,
whose appearance denoted that she sifted upon the
dust-heaps. She refused the tract which was offered
upon the ground that "it was no good to eat;" but
when told of the "true Bread," she opened the door
wider, and looking toward a bundle of rags, said, "You
can talk to my girl as is very bad, as I'm going out,"
and then she staggered downstairs.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span></p>

<p>The visitor approached the rags, upon which lay a
little girl of eleven years. She partly raised herself, as
if to look at the stranger, and then sunk back as though
exhausted with the effort. "I have come to talk to you
about Jesus, and to pray with you," said the Missionary,
taking hold of her emaciated hand, and then he paused
to give the little sufferer time to recover from the excitement
of his presence, and to glance round the room.
It was a wretched dwelling; filthy in the extreme; with
scarcely a vestige of furniture, unless the two boxes
which served for seats, and the planks placed across
pieces of wood, which served for a table, could be dignified
by that name. In one corner was a pile of old
kettles without spouts, and saucepans without handles
and lids. In the fireplace, which was without a fender
and filled with ashes, was a tinker's hand-fire&mdash;a saucepan
with round holes at the side and wire handle. In
different parts of the room were little heaps of dirty
rags, bottles, and greasepots. All this showed that the
occupant was a travelling tinker, who had been stopped
on his travels by the illness of the child, and that his
wife had obtained work upon a dust-heap, from which
she brought worn-out tinware for her husband to "doctor
up" and re-sell to the poor. Turning toward the
child, the visitor inquired how long she had lived there,
and if she could say the Lord's Prayer. In reply, the
child, panting at intervals for breath, in a low, hollow
tone, said, "For four or five Sundays, sir, I was ill, and
we had to sleep under a hedge, which made me worse;
and then we tramped on here, and the doctor has been
to see me, and says he can't do much for me, as I am
getting thin and can't eat;" and then raising herself
upon her arm, she continued, her eyes lighting up with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
a supernatural brightness, "I can't say all that prayer,
but I can the pretty hymn which is in the book under
my head. I can't read, but I know it's there." And
then the peach colour of her cheek deepened as she
opened the "penny hymn-book," and repeated the first
two verses of the hymn:</p>

<div class="poem">
<span class="i0">"'Come, let us join our cheerful songs</span><br />
<span class="i0">With angels round the throne.'"</span><br />
</div>

<p>Then she threw herself back as though exhausted, but
her face assumed an expression of intense happiness.
After a few minutes the question was asked, "And how
did you learn that hymn?" "A little girl at the tramps'
lodging, at Ipswich," she replied, "went to Sunday-school,
and took me with her for three Sundays: the
lady saw I was ill, and kissed me, and told me how to
say that hymn, and it makes me so happy. And I am
going to Him soon," she whispered, gazing up with
evident delight. "You must not talk any more, dear,"
said the visitor, "but I will now pray to Jesus, to whom
the angels in heaven are singing, and ask Him to make
you very good now, and then to take you to be with
Him in glory." "Ask <i>Him</i>," whispered the child, "to
make father and mother good: they get drunk and
frighten me so, and say such wicked words." The request
was complied with, and He who has told His
disciples to "ask that they may receive," was petitioned,
in simple language but in earnest prayer, to bless the
child and to save the parents.</p>

<p>A few necessaries were that evening sent for the child;
and two days after the Missionary again ascended that
dark staircase: he did so with pleasure, because he felt
that in that dismal room there was a little one who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
loved the Saviour, and who would soon be called to His
presence and personally blessed by Him. The door
was opened by the mother, who burst into tears and
turned away; upon glancing toward the bed of rags, the
visitor was startled at seeing a small elm coffin in its
place, and inquired when the child died. "Late in the
night when you were here," the mother replied, sobbing.
"She was in great pain, and sat up in the bed and took
out her little book, and said the hymn she was so fond
of&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<span class="i0">'Come, let us join our cheerful songs</span><br />
<span class="i0">With angels round the throne;'</span><br />
</div>

<p>and then her cough came on, and she fell back in the
bed and died like a lamb." While they were speaking,
the father, a low-looking tramp, came in; and the Missionary
told them of the child's request that he would
pray for them that they might be made good. Both of
them cried with intense feeling, and then they knelt
beside that little coffin, while prayer, deep earnest prayer,
was offered for their salvation. That evening, and for
several months after, they attended the meeting in the
Widow's room, and before they left the place for a settled
life, not a tramp's, the man gave proof of his reformation,
and the woman that she had believed to the saving of
her soul.</p>

<p>In that day when the Lord shall give to each of His
servants according as their work shall be, the lady who
taught that beggar child a hymn about His love and
glory, and won her heart to Him with a kiss of Christian
charity, will in no wise lose her reward.</p>

<div class="drop">
<img src="images/idrop_a.jpg" alt="A" width="66" height="98" class="cap" />
<p class="cap_1">ALL who knew "Roley-poley," as the children
delighted to call him, were convinced that
something was wrong with him or his affairs.
He was regarded as one of the respectables
of the Court; and as he left home, with his
huge narrow-edged basket, covered with a white
cloth, upon which were displayed slices of rolled currant-pudding
and plum-cake, he looked the pink of cleanliness.
His rosy, contented face, white calico cook's cap,
of which he was very proud, and his clean apron, were
as charms to his supporters,&mdash;the roughs and gutter
children. The partner of his life was also a partner in
the provision business, as she sold sheep's-trotters outside
the doors of the public-houses. Though both were
turned sixty they were healthy, and their room had an
appearance of comfort. It was plain that they prospered,
as in the afternoon they left with well-filled baskets, and
at night returned with them empty. Business difficulties
were not therefore the cause, and yet the good-natured
little man became ill-tempered, sharp with his customers,
and "cranky" with every one; and then his meek
little wife began to look wretched and speak of her
"troubles." Liquor was not the cause, as "Roley-poley<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>"
was a sober man: so the conclusion arrived at
was, that his "opinions," which of late had become very
peculiar, were at the root of the evil. This was confirmed
by his venturing an attack upon the Missionary,
with whom he had been generally on good terms: and
this is how the event occurred. The reader of the good
Book was standing in a door-way with a group of boys,
whose tossing for pence he had stopped by an offer to
read them the story of a young man who was thrown
into a den of lions. As "Roley-poley" passed with his
basket there was a diversion of attention and a fingering
of pence, with such a look at the tempting spread that
the retailer approached to do business. The youths
paused in their purchase to hear the end of the narrative,
which may have irritated the poor man, as he looked
spitefully toward the Book, and exclaimed, "That all
contradicts itself, and it's made up of lies by the parsons,
what doesn't produce nuffin, to keep us down and to
get our money, and it says, it does, that God come from
Teman, and nobody knows about that and Him; and
it's bad, cos it says we are to be like a man what told
people to steal a donkey. My opinion is, 'No religion
and our rights.'" He then toddled away, as one who
had let off the long condensed steam of "his opinions."</p>
</div>

<p>Next morning the Missionary entered his room to
seek an explanation, and was told that "such as him
wasn't wanted."</p>

<p>"Yes you be, master," exclaimed that meek little
woman, with positive anger. "He's a-turning infidel,
cos them shoemakers has lent him Tom Paine's book,
which he was reading all two Sundays; and now he's
miserable, and talks wicked, and goes to them infidel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
meetings, and doesn't stop out with the basket, cos he
ain't content-like, and wants other people's things."</p>

<p>"She's a wixen," retorted the husband; "and a
wixen what hasn't got reason, which is the worser sort
of wixens: and she is always a-reading her mother's
book, 'The Whole Duty of Man,' which is a parson's
book, and agin our rights."</p>

<p>The domestic jangle was stopped by the visitor
observing, "It is quite right in religion to use our
reason; as the Bible tells us to 'prove all things, and
to hold fast that which is good.'" And he then, in a
soothing tone of voice, and with simple illustrations,
proved to the poor man that God is, and that He is
the Rewarder of them who diligently seek Him; and
then assured him of his interest in the loving heart of
the Saviour.</p>

<p>The old man listened, and it was evident by the
manner he pursued his work of pudding-making that
he was the subject of an inward conflict. After washing
his apron, he poured the flour into the dirty old tub
with such vengeance as to create a cloud of dust, and
then he mixed with such energy that his arms were
soon covered with whitey-brown flakes. By the time
the dough was deposited upon the table he was calmer,
and toward the end of the operation the rolling-pin was
gently used. Rising from his seat the Missionary said
kindly, "I am sorry for you, as you have been injured.
The men have done you more harm by lending you
that book than if they had broken your arm. You have
struggled on together for a great many years, and ought
now to be trying to make your last days your best days.
That bad book will prevent this, and will rob you of
the hope of meeting together in heaven. Do, my good<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
friend, read your Bible, and ask God to take the wicked
thoughts out of your mind."</p>

<p>The wife, who was preparing her trotters in another
tub, burst out crying; and the tears started into the
poor man's eyes as he said, "I'll give 'em up, sir, and
I'll take to your Bible; and the name of the book I had
is 'The Age of Reason,' and the 'bus-washer has it, and
we was told not to let you see it."</p>

<p>A bad book, among a people so ignorant as the
dwellers in Paradise Court, is worse than a beast of
prey at large: so thought the visitor, as he hastened
to the room of the family who had received the book, in
hope of its capture. The man, an omnibus-washer, had
just returned from his work, at which he had been employed
since three in the morning. He was dirty and
haggard, but this was his usual condition; but the dark
frown upon his brow and the surly way in which he
received the visitor were new to him. He was one of
those to whom positive good had been done, and who
had evinced his gratitude. He had a sickly wife and
six children, and his hard earnings were only seventeen
shillings weekly. As in bad weather he worked a greater
part of the night, he had, no doubt from a feeling of
exhaustion, contracted the habit of having a quartern
of rum as soon as the public-house opened, which habit
greatly reduced his wages and led to after-drinking. No
wonder then that his family were at times in a starving
condition. His boy of seven was deaf and dumb, and a
great object of pity. One day a neighbour, to quiet his
moaning as he sat upon the stairs, gave him a penny.
The child hastened to the baker's and bought a loaf of
bread with it. As he entered the room gnawing it, the
other children, in savage hunger, sprang upon him and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
tore it out of his hands. This came to the knowledge
of the Missionary, who called upon the man to reason
with him about the spending of his wages. The Widow
had already been there, and had convinced the wife that
more could be made of the money if both were agreed.
As the results of the conference the man was induced
to sign the pledge; and to help him in forming habits
of sobriety, arrangements were made for him to receive
a breakfast of bread, butter, and coffee, at a house which
opened at five o'clock in the morning, and that free of
cost. By the time a fortnight was over the man had
improved in health, and was firm in his resolve to keep
the pledge and to continue his early breakfast. Good
results followed, for the wife became cheerful, the children
happy, and the room assumed an appearance of
comfort. A cloud had however now gathered over the
family, the man absented himself from home, and the
wife's Sunday shawl and wedding ring had again disappeared.
Their visitor was therefore concerned about
them, and this accounts for his hurrying to their room.
At first the man was sullen; but in reply to the remark,
"I fear that you have neglected your promise to read
a chapter daily?" he replied, "I'm the best scholar
down here or in the yard either, and I've found out how
we are kept down by the 'haristocrats;' and now I
understands what are our rights, I'll have my share of
the wealth which is the people's which produces it."
And then, clenching his fist, he exclaimed, "And if
fighting for it is to be done I'll do my share."</p>

<p>The visitor tried to secure his attention to the reason
and religion of the matter, but was stopped by the wife,
who to his astonishment, chimed in with the declaration,
that "the people were becoming enlightened, and were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
not to be kept down by religion, though some who
believed in it were good and some were bad." After
listening to them for a sufficient time to acquaint himself
with the full extent of the damage they had received,
he said sharply, "You have not had time to think over
the opinions you have accepted: when you have done
so you will discover your mistake, and I trust find to
your joy that the words of the Lord are pure, making
wise the simple." And then he left, with a sad heart at
the discouragement received.</p>

<p>Upon his next visit to the owner of "The Age of
Reason," the Missionary tried to convince him that he
was doing positive harm by circulating his book of
"advanced opinions," and instanced the parties to
whom we have referred. "I admit," he replied, "that
the immediate result of unsettling the mind is productive
of apparent evil; but we free thinkers, like good
surgeons, wound to heal and amputate to save. We do
not expect to annihilate the theological system of ages
without damage to individuals and to society. Our
principles will revolutionize and destroy until we are
able to build up a new moral system." He then told
the visitor that a Branch Secular Society of thirty
members had been formed at a neighbouring coffee-house,
and added, "After business on Saturday evenings
we intend to hold a discussion for the purpose of making
new members; and as I have the privilege of inviting a
friend, I shall be glad to see you there."</p>

<p>As several residents in the Court had joined the
Society, the Missionary felt that it was his duty for
their sakes to accept the invitation, and he therefore
entered the room at the appointed time. Its arrangements
were certainly comfortable and attractive, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
walls were neatly papered, and round the room were
twenty ornamental brackets, and upon each of these the
bust of an infidel writer, such as Byron, Chubb, Paine,
Shelley, Shaftesbury, Voltaire, and others. Under each
bracket was a small shelf, upon which were the works
of the man represented by the bust, and the effect was
very pretty. There was also a shelf with such books as
"A Short and Easy Method with the Saints." Upon
the table were the various infidel publications, and three
Bibles&mdash;the Authorized Version, the Douay, and Priestley.
There was also a Dictionary, and an auctioneer's hammer
for the use of the Chairman. This personage,
an ironmonger's foreman, was voted to the chair, and
congratulated the members upon the success of the
new movement. He then announced the subject for
discussion: "Does man require a revelation?" and
called upon the Secretary, a secular bookseller, to open
upon the negative side. He did so in a really clever
speech, clearing his way by stating truisms about the
force of the human intellect, man's capacity for knowledge,
and his power over the material world. He then
made an onslaught upon Christianity, charging it with
all the evil done in its name, and much more, and
proceeded to establish the proposition: "Science the
providence of life; spiritual dependency leading to
material destruction." He then took pains to show
"that morality is independent of Scriptural religion,"
and besought his hearers to reject the Book, which
reason and modern discovery proved to be false, and
to rely upon philosophy and science for the attainment
of social and political equality with their upraising and
happy influences.</p>

<p>Upon taking his seat he was applauded, and then the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
Missionary rose, with his pocket Bible in his hand, and
said, "I trust that you, Mr. Chairman, and the members
of this Society, will extend to me the courtesy usually
shown to strangers, by allowing me to speak to the
affirmative of this question; and as this is my first
attempt to take part in a debate, I am sure that you
will grant me your forbearance should I inadvertently
trespass upon your rules of discussion. Now, as your
Secretary has placed philosophy and science in antagonism
to this Book, and stated that these are the weapons
of your warfare with which Christianity and our social
state are to be destroyed and supplanted, let me reply by
taking the position, 'That philosophy is only groping in
the dark for the Bible, and that science is only hobbling
after it.' (Laughter.) This is a great subject, and we
ought to approach it with modesty, because many of
the best, the noblest, and the most learned of our race
have believed in the Bible. Sir Isaac Newton from his
observatory scanned the starry canopy, and then confirmed
the statement of the Hebrew poet, that 'the
heavens declare the glory of God, and the firmament
showeth forth His handy work.' And let me here
remind you that true philosophy&mdash;skill in the science
of nature&mdash;is after all a spiritual product from the exercise
of man's intellect upon the works of creation: as,
for instance, the atomic theory is the fruit of reason in
chemistry. You have therefore to accept the arguments
of philosophers whose reasoning contradicts your senses,
as when they tell us that the earth goes round the sun.
If then in natural phenomena we have to use our reason
in accepting or rejecting the theories of men, does it not
lead to the conviction that reason itself requires to be
enlightened and directed in matters beyond its power<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90"></a></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89"></a></span>
of action? It is in necessary truths which man by
searching cannot discover, that communications from the
Creator becomes needful; and this Book contains such
revelations: true philosophy therefore leads up to it.
And now let me, on the authority of the historian
Neander, remind you that before Christianity gave the
idea no one thought of forming a system of enlightenment
which could extend to the people. The Stoic,
Epicurean, and Platonic forms of philosophy recognize
two classes of mankind&mdash;the noble-minded who formed
their disciples, and the gross multitudes whom they
avoided as sunk hopelessly in degradation. The Founder
of the Christian religion, however, rose above the human
philosophers, by proclaiming His mission to the common
people, and in this way raising humanity to the standard
of an universal brotherhood." The speaker was here
stopped by shouts of contradiction; but he produced
silence by holding out the Bible, and exclaiming in an
impassioned manner, "Philosophy and science can lead
man to the intellectual enjoyment of nature and to
maxims of wisdom: they can also trouble him with
grave perplexities. They teach him that matter is indestructible,
and that there is a constant restoring of
the face of nature; and in this way they raise in his
mind the important questions, 'Are my intellectual
powers to be destroyed while matter only undergoes
a change?' and 'If a man die shall he live again?'
You who reject this Book look down into the grave and
discover a darkness which can be felt but not penetrated.
We, however, who accept this revelation, look into its
darkness and discover flashes of celestial glory which
make a passage-way to an immortality of blessedness.
The song of victory over death belongs to the Christian<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
philosopher, who, looking into the grave, exclaims with
joy, 'The <i>Lord</i> has risen indeed, and because He lives
I shall live also.'"</p>

<p>As the speaker resumed his seat there was a great
sensation among the infidels. All had listened with
breathless attention to his closing remarks, but the old
free-thinkers regarded him with angry looks, while the
young men cheered heartily. It was some minutes before
a member rose to reply, and he did not grapple
with the question; he rather railed at the man with the
Book, and gave an opinion that "he was an enthusiast,
and ought not to be allowed to enter their houses, as his
influence in their families and among their neighbours
would ruin the secular cause, and promote priestcraft."
As this was personal, the Christian visitor rose, and with
a pleasant remark to the Chairman left the room.</p>

<p>For a time the infidel society flourished, as its members
put forth much inducement and effort, and effected
a large circulation of their books, publications, and tracts.
The Missionary however fought a foot-to-foot conflict
with them, by visiting each member at his house, by
changing their books for those containing an antidote,
and by a large circulation of well-chosen tracts. As
they removed their discussion class to a neighbouring
hall, and secured an attendance of from 140 to 180 men,
amongst whom were many foreigners, he for fifty-two
Saturday evenings attended and took part in the debates.
These efforts were made to result in good; the Missionary
however had the sorrow of seeing several of
his people confirmed in unbelief. One of these was a
labourer, who read the "Age of Reason," attended a
discussion, and was ever after an enemy to the truth.
There were others who used the infidel objections they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
heard as a means to harden conscience, that they might
pursue their evil ways. Among these were two women,
called by the people the "'strology woman," and the
"imp woman."</p>

<p>The former of these belonged to a gang of fortune-telling
impostors, who lived in the poor neighbourhoods
of West London. One of these was a scissors-grinder,
whose wife was a mulatto. When travelling with his
machine he used to circulate cards among female servants,
with his address, and the announcement that his
wife "repaired parasols and cut cards." Another of the
party was a vulgar over-dressed man, who styled himself
"professor," and kept a magic mirror, to which silly
girls were attracted by the promise of a peep at their
future partners. The "'strology woman" assisted those
persons when so pressed with business as to require aid,
and she did a little lying on her own account among a
lower class of dupes. The room at the corner of the
Court was suited for her black-art purposes, as persons
could slip in unnoticed, and there was no passage for
other lodgers. She was about forty years of age, and
unmarried. She only received her inquirers after six in
the evening, and then she dressed in a gaudy kind of
Eastern costume, with fantastic head-dress, and large
coral necklace, from which was suspended a bunch of
heavy charms. The front was the waiting room, and the
back was the audience chamber. This latter was well
furnished and strangely decorated. Over the mantle-shelf
was a badly painted chart of the twelve signs of
the zodiac, and at the side a picture of Daniel's vision
of the four beasts. Upon the table was a Prayer-Book,
several well-worn packs of cards, a celestial globe, and
a number of "nativity" papers, with space for filling in.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
At the side was a small deal table covered with bottles
and powder papers, containing marvellous novelties for
her foolish "inquirers." "Fate powders (made of brick
dust), with directions for use, so as to produce dreams of
the future,"&mdash;threepence. "Compression of the damask
rose, to give to the face a not-to-be-resisted charm"
(rouge and lard in small pill box),&mdash;sixpence. "The
spirit of love: a fascination" (common scent in small
bottle), tenpence; and other articles of equal attraction.
The woman boasted that among the girls who thronged
to consult her were many respectable young women, to
whom she had spoken and given cards in the parks and
streets. At first she avoided the Missionary, and when
he succeeded in speaking to her she listened with marked
respect; his faithfulness however very soon produced a
rupture, and it happened in this way. One evening a
group of poor girls assembled, before the woman, who
was from home, returned to open the door. The Missionary,
who was passing, gave tracts, and explained to
them the sin and folly of consulting a wicked woman
about the future, which was only known to the Almighty.
While he was speaking the "'strology woman" came up,
and the girls in their confusion scampered away. To
his surprise she asked him into her consulting room, and
in a bland, deceptive tone remonstrated with him for
interfering with her affairs. "I will," said the Visitor,
"answer you out of this Holy Bible, that you may know
that it is the great <i>God</i>, and not myself, speaking to
you." And then he opened it and read, "When I say
unto the wicked, O wicked man, thou shalt surely die;
if thou dost not speak to warn the wicked from his way,
that wicked man shall die in his iniquity; but his blood
will I require at thine hand."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span></p>

<p>"Them girls," she continued, "them silly girls like to
be befooled, and none of 'em 'ardly believes the cards
when I cuts 'em, and what I says about their stars and
nativities; but it amuses 'em, and does 'em no harm."</p>

<p>The pages of the Book were turned over, and the
words read, "Ye shall not steal, neither deal falsely,
neither lie one to another." But she added in a softer
tone of voice, "Astrology is true, as it says in the Bible
of the stars, that 'they are given for signs,' and that
'He gives wisdom to understand secrets;' and that is
why the Professor has a Prayer-Book, and I has one
here, that they may feel that it comes of religion; and
it does lots of good, and makes 'em steady and religious
like, and it's no sort of harm."</p>

<p>The leaves of the Book were again turned over, and
the Scripture read: "O full of all subtlety and all mischief,
thou child of the devil, thou enemy of all righteousness,
wilt thou not cease to pervert the right way of
the Lord?" As the Book was closed a frown gathered
upon her face, and springing from her chair she, with
awful imprecations, ordered the reader out, telling him
"that he was a deceiver, as lots of people in the Court
knew that the Bible was a lying Book."</p>

<p>The "imp woman" was quite a different style of
person. She was of middle age, and had three miserable
little children dependent upon her, as her husband had
absconded. These, with several others whom she borrowed
as business required, provided a good living, as
she supplied several of the low theatres with imp
children, used in pantomimes and plays to represent
huge frogs, cats, and other animals, also angels and
goblins. She was a large consumer of gin; and it was
well known that she gave abundance to her children, to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
stop their growth, as they decreased in value as they
increased in size. Employers at the theatres used to
come to fit the skins and to instruct the children in their
duties. These were of the most ludicrous kind, and
her boy of six did the monkey so well that for two
Christmas seasons he earned a pound a week. This
training in the skins was painful until the children got
"into shape" as it was called. One afternoon the Missionary
approached the door, which was partly open,
and was startled by the stifled sobbing of the youngest,&mdash;a
tiny girl of not quite five years. Upon entering the
room he saw that the sobs proceeded from a blue fiend,
which was wagging its forked tail and shaking its bat-wings
upon the table, the woman standing over the
creature with a cane. "This is shameful," he exclaimed,
taking the fiend into his arms; and then he burst the
cord, and set the child free. He then turned toward the
mother and said severely, "This case was made for the
child last year, and if your cruelty in forcing her to move
in it was known, you would have six months' hard
labour. As this Book says, you must be without natural
affection, and it "would be better for you all to go into
the workhouse, or to beg your bread, than to live in this
way."</p>

<p>"You ain't got no business to come here!" exclaimed
the woman in a rage. "And she's a hobstinate hussey,
she is; and as for natural affection, there's men better
than you as knows as the Bible keeps us down and ain't
true. And I does love my children, and I must get a
living for 'em, sitewated as I am."</p>

<p>The child trembled, and threw her arms round the
neck of her deliverer. To calm them both he said
quietly: "You know very well that I am everybody's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
friend, and I can't help caring for your little children.
When the Saviour was on earth He blessed little dears
like this, and we who know the Bible to be true must
love and care for them."</p>

<p>As he paused she burst out crying, and the child,
seeing that the storm was over, sprang into her arms,
hugging and kissing her in a most affectionate manner.
It was a touching sight, and cleared the way for an important
conversation. The mother admitted that the
health of the children was suffering from their training
and exposure to the night air when returning from the
theatres, and upon the visitor promising to place her
eldest boy, aged seven years, into a Refuge, she with
evident gratitude promised "to give up the imp business,
and to be a Christian, and to work her fingers to the
bone for her poor forsaken children." The little people
evidently understood and believed her, as they clapped
their hands with delight, and danced round the room
after their departing friend.</p>

<p>Among the group of broken-down men who made the
tramp's lodging-house their home, was a decrepit person
who had evidently turned sixty years of age. His companions
always addressed him as "Strong Bill," a name
so opposite to his appearance as to require an explanation.
This was given one winter's day as the Reader
of the Book sat with several of them before the kitchen
fire. A stranger entered who, after depositing several
pockets full of broken victuals upon the table, approached
the fire and stopped a serious conversation with the
exclamation, "Well, if it ain't Strong Bill&mdash;haven't seen
you, old fellow, for years. How are you getting on?"
The man of powerful name shook his head, struck his
breast, and in a sorrowful tone replied, "Very queer,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
very, not the same man as I was. Tell this 'ere gent,
Bobby, 'cause as how he wouldn't take it in if I said it
myself, what I did when I was a young chap&mdash;how I
was known all over London as 'the strong man,' how I
dressed tight and carried two weights, each a real
hundred, about with me, and as how I used to get rings
of people round me by throwing up the weights and
catching 'em like baby balls. Didn't I get lots of money,
that's all; but it's all up now, it's all up." The stranger
readily confirmed this statement, and enlarged upon the
feats of strength once performed by his old acquaintance.
"It's a great thing to have a well-built frame,
and a man ought to rejoice and thank God when he
feels as strong as a lion," observed the Reader; "but the
inside strength is best of all; we are weak creatures&mdash;the
strongest of us, without it," and then he with feeling read
and commented upon the words: "Blessed is the man
whose strength is in Thee." "I knows nothing about
that 'ere," said 'Strong Bill;' "but I em a weak sinner,
I em a bad lot." "Then come to my meeting to-morrow
evening, and I will read and talk about 'strength and
weakness.'" "We will, master," several exclaimed.
They came, and in his weakness the once strong man
was made glad to hear of Him who in mercy strengthens
weak sinners with the mightiness of God.</p>

<p>In this way ignorance and infidelity, in their varied
forms, were met and grappled with; and though disappointments
and annoyances were of daily occurrence,
there were at times gracious and unexpected proofs of
blessing. The most pleasing of these occurred one
morning as the Missionary was passing down the Court.
The young infidel, who had for several weeks treated
him with reserve, opened his window, and handing him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
a parcel of books and publications, said with a tremulous
voice, "I believe, sir, upon the Lord Jesus Christ, and
have laid down my weapons of rebellion; and in proof
of it I give you these books, which have damaged my
own soul, and by which I have injured others." This
confession of faith so surprised the man who had been
set for the defence of the truth, that he was unable for
the moment to reply; he however took the parcel, and
passing into the room seized the hand of the convert
and exclaimed, "The Lord Jehovah hath dealt mercifully
by you, and blessed be His name."</p>

<p>The door was then closed, and the young man, in
reply to inquiries, made the following statement: "Upon
the first night of our discussion I was made miserable
by your speech, as I saw that ours was a system of
negations, and that our pretensions to philosophy and
science were but groping and hobbling after revealed
truth. Since then I have read many books against the
Bible, and at times have been made comfortable in unbelief.
Your speech, however, on Saturday week carried
conviction to my mind, and the next day I offered up
my first prayer for light and salvation. The past week
has been one of bitterness, and I yesterday decided to
cast myself in simple faith upon the mercy of the Saviour,
and to acknowledge Him before men."</p>

<p>Need we add that he was strengthened in the faith of
the Gospel, and that his spiritual father knelt with him
in prayer. The Missionary hastened over to the Widow's
with the parcel, to examine its contents, which were
very curious. There were twenty numbers of the <i>Reasoner</i>,
many numbers of the <i>Free Thinker</i> and the <i>Red
Republican</i>, eighteen copies of "Why should the Atheist
fear to die?" several volumes, and among them the long<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
sought for "Age of Reason," the book which had
wrought so much evil among the people. The writer
has now this book before him, and he never saw a
volume more worn. The covers and edges are nearly
destroyed with handling, and every page is soiled. The
frontispiece, which has been carefully preserved, shows
contempt for the ordained servants of God, as the text
does of His holy Word. It represents a fat Bishop,
running away from a rock upon which the word "reason"
is inscribed, with a lamb under one arm and a sheaf of
corn under the other. At the meeting that evening the
reclaimed infidel sat beside the Widow, and to the
astonishment of the people knelt reverently in prayer.
At the next discussion he spoke on the Christian side,
and boldly acknowledged his change of opinion and his
faith in Christ. For several months he gave evidence
of a change of heart; and as he expressed a desire
further to confess Christ by partaking of the Sacrament,
he was introduced to the Rector; and after he had
undergone a suitable preparation, the Missionary had
the great joy of kneeling with him at the table of the
Lord, there to commemorate that blood-shedding whereby
alone we obtain remission of our sins, and to receive
the richer blessings of His grace.</p>

<p class="cap_1">TIME glided on pleasantly, as time always
does when occupied with the activities of
the Christian life, and brought the Missionary
to the third anniversary of the day
upon which he first entered Paradise Court.
As that had become a commemorative day of
deep interest to many of the inhabitants, their
visitor had arranged with them to raise an Ebenezer of
praise. As he entered the Place with his old friend the
Superintendent, there were pleasant greetings on every
hand. The children ran in a flock to meet him; and as
if to show the good they had received, the eldest girl of
the "translator," who three years before had boasted
that "his children knew nothing of superstition," held
for his inspection a reward-card which she had received
at a Sunday-school. Salvation had come to that man's
room, and he rejoiced in it, and his wife and family were
made glad. The Court itself gave indications that good
influences had been at work there, as its general appearance
was cleaner, and window-sills were ornamented
with flower-pots and boxes. The gift of a few flowers
had given pleasure to those of the poor who had come<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
from the country, and had served as texts for lessons
upon the value of pure air and cleanliness; while to
many it was a discovery, that though the atmosphere
was foul and black, they might have a thing of beauty
and fragrance at their windows for part of the year.
The appearance of the people was much the same, as all
looked poor, and some had tattered clothes; but the
police knew that rows had almost ceased, and that there
was less depravity and law-breaking than formerly;
and better still, the visitor knew that the restoring influence
of grace had upraised some of the families, as he
could make his way to rooms in which the Bible was
valued, and in which its teaching had led to saving faith
and holy living. On Sunday morning, as usual, women
went to market, and returned with aprons full of provisions;
but these were not so numerous as formerly, and
those who did so showed their sense of wrong-doing by
making excuse for their conduct. A disposition for
hearing the truth had been created, as the Widow's room
had long become too small, and the meeting had to be
removed to double rooms in a street just by. These
proofs of blessing had led to arrangements for a praise-meeting
in the Widow's room at twelve o'clock, and it
was filled with men and women who had managed to
spend part of the dinner hour in holy exercise. The
hymn, "Praise ye the Lord, 'tis good to raise," was
sung; the hundred and forty-fifth Psalm was read, with
a short comment upon the words, "All Thy works shall
praise Thee, O Lord, and Thy saints shall bless Thee;"
and then the language of praise ascended from that poor
Court as incense to the throne of heavenly grace. In
the evening a tea was given in the meeting-room to the
forty persons who usually attended. Two hours were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
spent in social intercourse, and two in hymn-singing,
prayer, and the hearing of suitable addresses. The
Wesleyan and Independent ministers took part in the
proceedings; and when the Rector, who had joined the
party, pronounced the Benediction, the people separated,
praising and blessing God.</p>
</div>

<p>There was only one thing which cast a shade over the
happy meeting, and that was the state of the Widow's
health. All noticed that while her happiness was intense,
her words were few; and there were grave shakings of
the head, and anxious remarks about her not having
been like herself for some time past. This was evident
when, as usual, upon the following Wednesday she took
dinner with the Missionary. This arrangement had
been made out of consideration to her, and in order that
they might consult together about the details of the
work. That hour of conference with his wife and the
Widow was of importance, as a knowledge of individual
character (so valuable to those who would be wise in
soul-winning) was obtained, and plans of action arranged.
Upon her way back to the Court she was
silent, and leant heavily upon the arm of her friend.
On the following Wednesday she was unable to leave
her room, so part of the evening was spent with her in
sweet converse about the covenant which is ordered
in all things and sure. At parting she said softly, "I
am so happy, and so close to heaven that a <i>waft</i> would
take me in;" and then after a pause she added, "To see
Jesus: the fairest among ten thousand!" After this she
grew more feeble; but when her friend called in one
evening she seemed better, though drowsy. He therefore
offered up a short prayer and left. Early in the
morning two women came in haste to his house, to say<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
that the Widow was dead. He hurried back with them,
and found the Place in a state of commotion. The
people were standing in groups, and round the door was
a company of weeping women. He passed them, and
with soft tread entered the chamber of death, as he felt
the solemn influence which pervaded the room. In the
stillness of the night the angels had been there, and had
taken a redeemed soul back with them into the everlasting
habitations of the blessed. The shutters had
been partly opened, and a gleam of light was thrown
upon the bed, where lay, as though prepared for burial,
the remains of the soldier's widow. Taking the icy-cold
hand affectionately in his, he gazed into the face, which
appeared to be set in calm sleep, and felt that no pains
of death had been permitted to distress the holy dying
of the aged saint. Upon the table lay the open Bible,
with her spectacles upon a page of the Psalms, and near
them her quarterly ticket, with "Ruth Peters" written
upon it. The doctor, who had seen her the day before,
said that an inquest would not be necessary, as he could
give a proper certificate; the remains were therefore
left in the care of several women, who loved her as a
mother.</p>

<p>The same kind hand which had supplied the needs of
the Widow, provided a suitable funeral. Ah, and that
was an honourable burial, for she was carried to the
grave by six men of the Court, who left their work for
the purpose; and as the coffin was borne through the
Place, followed by several of the neighbours, with the
Missionary as chief mourner, the people made great
lamentation over her. And when the earth was dropped
into the grave, with the solemn utterance, "Earth to
earth, ashes to ashes, dust to dust," all felt that at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
resurrection of the just that body would be raised and
made like unto Christ's glorious body.</p>

<p>The Missionary hastened from the funeral to meet the
County Member, as he had arranged that evening to
visit the district. The honourable gentleman had been
so pressed to place boys into "Homes," that he decided
to see the people for whom he was asked to do so much.
In the evening, when they entered the Court, there was,
for so crowded a place, deep silence; and as they passed
from room to room, they had to speak words of comfort
to the people who were sorrowing for the loss of their
friend. And they were sweet words of heavenly consolation
which the stranger uttered. As he left the
Place he leant for a moment upon a post at the entrance,
and said thoughtfully, "I wish you had told me about
that Widow, as I should like to have known her." Soon
after he sent the Missionary a book in memory of his
sainted wife ("Our Friends in Heaven"), and wrote in it,
"Not death, she said, but life, life, life, eternity!" And
when the days of his sojourn were accomplished, he with
like words crossed to the celestial side of the river.
And may he not know the Widow now? May it not
be one of the joys of the heavenly state to hold sweet
converse with saints about whom we have only heard
upon earth? May it not indeed be an employment of
enduring delight to be continually enlarging our acquaintance,&mdash;to
know and to be known of the innumerable
company of the redeemed?</p>

<p>The removal of the Widow was a felt loss, but the
bereavement was the means of leading several of the
poor to yield themselves to God. The worker had lost
his right hand, and yet the work was made to prosper.
For several months the attendance at the meeting increased,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
though there was a constant drafting away to
the regular ministry. At one of these meetings he took
for exposition the speech of St. Paul to the elders of the
Church at Ephesus. At the close he referred for the
second time to the words, "Therefore watch, and remember
that for the space of three years I ceased not to
warn every one night and day with tears;" and after an
effort gently to break the news, he said abruptly, "I am
about to leave you, as the Lord in His providence has
made it plain that He has important work for me to do
elsewhere." This announcement brought the meeting
to a close, as the people left their seats and surrounded
him with expressions of real sorrow.</p>

<p>For some days after there was earnest visiting in the
Court, as the Missionary felt the responsibility of speaking
to the people for the last time; and as a proof of
the power of domiciliary visitation in overcoming opposition
to the truth, not one person, from the beginning to
the end of the Place, uttered an offensive word; while
many gave him a hearty welcome and a tearful good-bye.
Take for instance, the "prize-fighter," who had
not quite recovered from a successful pugilistic encounter
with a Birmingham man, for ten pounds a side, as his
face was bruised and discoloured, and his right arm disabled.
He received the visitor with what to him was a
painful smile, and then in a confidential manner said, "It
tain't sir, as I 'em a-gettin soft, that I've resoluted; but I
haven't got over that backhander you gave me out of
that Book, as was, 'Will a man fight his Maker?' and
the way you closed in was stunnin; and says I to myself,
I 'em knocked over the ropes, and I'll let the
whiskers grow, and take to costering; that's summut,
ain't it?" "The wearing of whiskers," was the reply,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
"will put you out of the prize-ring; and you will find
that there is more happiness in getting an honest living
with the blessing of Almighty God upon you, than there
can be in wearing the 'Champion Belt of England' with
His curse." "Haven't I wished for him to be out of the
magic circle," exclaimed his wretched, vulgar-looking
wife, "as you see the feeling is awful when your 'usband
is going to be pitched into and knocked to a mummy;
and you must be a fighter's lawful wife to know the
feelin when it's a-goin on. If you drinks 'ard, why you
can't leach 'im and poultice 'im, as is a tender job: and
if he's beat, you gets nuffink; and when he beats, you
treats ring pals and wagabons; and the money it tain't
no good, and it tain't Christian-like as you says; and
if you'll stick to him, though you are a-goin, I'll wade
through seas of blood for you, as the sayin is." Their
friend smiled graciously at this assurance, and then
taking a seat, opened the Book, and read to them about
Him who was wounded for our transgressions and
bruised for our iniquities.</p>

<p>The day before leaving, the Missionary announced his
intention of bidding the people farewell at six o'clock
next evening in the open Court, and of then introducing
his successor to them. As at the appointed time they
entered the Place, it was so densely packed that they
with difficulty pressed to the bend in the middle. A
chair was handed from a window, and as their friend
stepped upon it the murmur of voices burst into a loud
cheer. Looking round, he saw an expression of sorrow
upon that mass of upturned faces, and near him stood the
reclaimed infidel, the fighting man, the chanter, Tom and
Bess, and others for whom he had a Christian affection.
For a few moments he remained silent with emotion,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
and then with faltering and afterwards with firmer voice
said, "I think, my good friends, that I have shaken
hands and said Good-bye to each of you in your rooms;
but I have thought it well that we should have a last
meeting, and together ask our heavenly Father to bless
and to take care of us. The four years I have gone in
and out among you have been years of happiness; at
first we did not understand each other, but from the
time you discovered that my one object in life was to
lead you to the Lord Jesus Christ that you might
be made good and happy, you have regarded me
as your friend. Some of you have believed to the
saving of your souls. (A cry of "Bless the Lord.")
Let me, as your father in Christ, beseech of you to
regard this Holy Book as you do your necessary food,&mdash;to
live lives of daily, constant prayer, always looking to
Jesus. There are others here who respect me as the
King's messenger, but who do not care for the message
of a Saviour's mercy, which I have delivered to them.
You are going as fast as time can carry you to the
grave,&mdash;to hell: faster and faster from heaven. Listen
to my last words, as I shall meet you when the dead,
small and great, shall stand before the judgment seat of
Christ. Turn from your evil ways, from your drunken
habits, your Sabbath breaking, your iniquities. And in
the name of Jesus, because He died upon the cross to
save you, ask Almighty God to pardon and to give you
His Holy Spirit, that you may be Christians indeed."
And then raising his pocket Bible, and looking up to
heaven, he continued, "Let us all so live that we may
meet in glory: the Widow is there, and some out of this
place have already followed her. Let us hate sin, trust
in the Saviour, and press on for the crown of life." Here<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
the emotion of the people became so great that several
exclaimed, "We will," and others "May the Lord have
mercy upon us." The speaker then said, "I will now
introduce your new Missionary, by asking him to read
something to us out of the good old Book; you will
then see him and hear his voice: when he has done, I
will offer prayer; after that he will stand in my place
to you. Receive him as one sent from God, to show
unto you the way of eternal life, and prove your love to
me by treating him as my friend."</p>

<p>The stranger then took his place upon the chair, and
read the hundred and third psalm, after which the old
friend rose to offer the parting prayer. As the
words, "Let us pray," rung through the Court, battered
hats and fur caps were removed, so all the men stood
uncovered, and several of the women knelt down; while
at the windows and in the crowd, many covered their
faces with their hands. The prayer was short but
earnest. At its close the word "Amen" was uttered so
loud and clear, that it seemed to come from a church
congregation, rather than from that strange gathering of
worshippers; and after the Benediction the word was
uttered with still deeper feeling; and then, amidst the
tears, the thanks, and blessings of the people, and
humbled before God, because of the mission blessings
received, the man with the Book passed out of Paradise
Court.</p>

<p>He did not, however, and has not to this day, lost
interest in the people. At intervals he visited in the
place with the Missionary, but on each occasion found
some of his old friends gone, and at length, his acquaintance
there became very small. Among those who remained,
was drunken (now sober) Sammy. He became<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
a member of the Baptist chapel, and never broke his
pledge. His attendance at the means of grace and at
temperance meetings was regular, and he won the respect
of Church members and abstaining companions.
When the friend who had stopped him in the road to
ruin called, he treated him with a respect approaching
to reverence. He died at the age of seventy, after a
short illness, in which he gave evidence of meetness for
heaven.</p>

<p>Persons who have left the Court, have frequently been
met with in the streets and elsewhere, and several remarkable
proofs of good were in this way brought to
light; as, for instance, in the case of a little deformed
man of uncertain age, strange expression of countenance,
and rather weak intellect, who shared a back attic with
a crossing sweeper, and paid one shilling a week rent.
He called himself a "fagger," and lived as quite a
number of men do, by searching the streets of London
by night and at early morning for lost money and property.
These "faggers," may be seen walking at a
steady pace, or trotting gently, glancing keen looks along
the road and pavement. They always pause at corners
where omnibuses stop; at the doors of theatres and
other likely places. In the season they all make for the
"Haymarket," as the place where valuables such as
rings may be found, and when the "cafs" close, they
make for home, searching as they go.</p>

<p>Our "fagger," as a child of the night, was rarely seen
by day. He was indeed quite a recluse, as he shrunk
from the derision to which his unsightly appearance
subjected him from the children and his ignorant neighbours.
So they only saw him when he shuffled out at
night, or trotted back early in the morning. He for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
months refused the Missionary admission to the room,
and was angry when his landlord, the sweeper, insisted
upon receiving the visits, and he used on these occasions
to seat himself upon his stool in the corner with a sulky
expression of face. After a time his confidence was obtained,
and it was then discovered that the poor simple
man was utterly ignorant of saving truth. He had entered
upon life as a "City Arab," could not read, had
never been into a place of worship, and had not even
heard the name of the Saviour. Little did the sower
think, as the seed of the kingdom fell so freely from his
hand, that it was to find good ground in the heart of
the poor "fagger." He became deeply interested in
the readings from the Bible, and at the farewell visit
he drew his stool nearer, and his eyes brightened as the
sweeper and himself listened to St. John's narrative of
the crucifixion.</p>

<p>Nearly a year had passed after this visit when a group
of eight or ten persons assembled in Oxford Circus. It
was long after midnight, and bitterly cold. The Missionary
who was passing, approached, and two policemen
to whom he was known, informed him that the
well-dressed man who lay upon the kerb, with a frightful
gash upon the forehead, was in liquor, and had fallen
against the lamp-post. As the man was stunned, if not
seriously injured, the police were advised to take him to
the hospital, and one of them left to get a stretcher for
that purpose. By this time a number of depraved men
and women had gathered round, some of whom uttered
ribald jokes, one woman suggesting "that as the gent
was dead, they had better search his pockets for money,
with which to drink to his memory." "And if dead,"
exclaimed the Missionary in a voice so loud and solemn<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
that the people were startled: "if dead, his eternal state
is fixed; the day of mercy over; and there is a fearful
meeting with the Judge of heaven and earth." For a
few moments there was silence, when a man near the
lamp said, "He knows nothing about it, as no one ever
came back from the other world to tell us." Before a
reply could be given, an odd-looking little man who had
pressed into the circle, exclaimed, "He does know: he's
got it in his Book. They nailed Jesus to the cross, they
did; He got out of the grave, He did; He's alive a
savin' us, He is; it's in the gent's Book, it is: he knows
it;" and then the little "fagger," for it was he, trotted
away, as if astonished at himself. "That poor man is
right," said the Missionary, "The Lord Jesus is alive to
save sinners." No more could be said, as the policeman
arrived with the stretcher, and as they bore the injured
man away, some of the crowd followed, but many who
were sinners remained to hear the Gospel more fully.</p>

<p>The Missionary followed in the direction the "fagger"
had taken, and found him in Pall Mall. They stood for
some time under the colonnade of the opera house, and
there the man of feeble intellect called Jesus, Lord, and
repeated the simple prayer he used. A few months after
this he was removed to the infirmary, in abject poverty
and increased mental weakness. At times, however, he
used to sit in Poverty Square (a yard in the workhouse),
muttering to himself the one great truth he had grasped,&mdash;that
the crucified Jesus was a living Saviour; and
while a ray of reason remained this gave him comfort.
When last heard of his mind had entirely gone, but he
was for years a living proof that the grand truth of
salvation can be grasped by the feeblest as well as by
the mightiest intellect.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span></p>

<p>The "niggers" were met with under very different
circumstances. Several summers after the visit to their
dressing-room and the rescue of "Black Poll," their
friend was walking upon the sands at Broadstairs in
company with three ladies. They stopped to listen to
an entertainment which some "niggers," who had formed
themselves into a circle, were about to give. As he knew
them, and did not care that they should then recognise
him, he kept at the back of the assembled listeners.
Towards the close, there was a peculiar "ogling" between
the "artistes," and a looking in one direction, and
then they brought their entertainment to a sudden close;
and to the surprise of the company, and the horror of
the three ladies (who slipped off), they fairly rushed
toward their friend, and in the most demonstrative
manner owned him as such. "I has bin to see Poll,"
exclaimed Dusty, "and she's growed a wapper, and
took to hedecation, as is her nature. And she writ me
a letter, and if I sees yer honour arter dark I'll bring
it; and now the ladies are out we picks up fourpennies
and sixpennies, and when they goes in the tother sort
comes out, an' we only gets browns." For the time it
was a relief to be rid of them, so an appointment was
made upon the sands at ten o'clock that night. The
men, who had left their instruments behind them, were
waiting, and a strangely pleasant hour was spent with
them. As they stood at the edge, or rather followed
the receding tide, the moon casting her soft light upon
the rippling waves, the "niggers" listened, and in their
way conversed about truths which concerned their salvation.
The confidential utterance of the fiddler, will show
the influence of Christian effort with such people. "You
sees, sir," he said, "that this ain't a religious sort of business,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
but I can't be no other but a 'nigger,' and I has a
wife an' three youngsters, what are always a-hopening
of their mouths and must have summut to put into 'em.
But I has given up getting drunk and cursing as I used,
and wheresomever I bees on Sunday, I slips in to hear
religion preached, if there ain't nuffin of that ere sort a-going-on
in the open, as I prefers."</p>

<p>The presence of the "niggers" reminds us of their
near neighbour in London, the convict's widow, and
we will therefore finish her little history. Every six
months, for nearly five years, her son at the convict
establishment sent a letter to his teacher. At the end
of that time the chaplain wrote to say that he was to be
discharged with a ticket-of-leave, as his conduct had
been very good. As it was thought well to keep him
from his mother, a room was taken for him near to his
teacher, as he never ceased to call him. His case was
mentioned to a Christian man, a builder, who promised
when his hair was grown to give him work, and to keep
the secret of his antecedents from others. Upon his
discharge the convict came direct to his friend's house,
where his mother was ready to receive him; and the
meeting was most affecting, as she hugged and kissed
her son, who had grown a big man, as though he had
been a child. When in quiet conversation that evening,
the convict spoke with feeling of the reading upon the
housetop, and added, "That night in the police cell I
laid upon my face for several hours, sobbing and praying
for mercy. I knew that I had done wrong, and
didn't fear the punishment; all I wanted was God's
pardon, and I believe that He did forgive me the next
evening, as I lay praying in the cell at the detention
house, for I then felt that Jesus was my Saviour, and it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
was the happiest evening of my life. At Dartmoor I
have borne my punishment in the spirit of prayer, and I
am glad of my discharge that I may show forth the
praise of the Saviour." A few Sundays after, when his
hair was sufficiently grown for him to mix with others,
he was introduced to a branch of the Young Men's
Christian Association, of which he became a member.
He went to his work, and did well until the time of his
full discharge. Soon after this the fact of his being
a returned convict became known to his fellow-workmen
and Christian friends: this caused him constant
and bitter annoyance. One evening he came to his
"teacher," and said, "You know, sir, that I have desired
to be a soldier, and would have enlisted if I had not
committed that last crime. As all is known about me,
I can't stop at the builder's, and don't know where to
go; so I think that I shall take the Queen's shilling, as I
can be as good a Christian in the army as out of it."
He acted on this resolution, and enlisted into a regiment
then serving in India. He wrote several letters to his
mother and teacher, telling them that he was very happy
in his new calling, and that he had joined a soldiers'
prayer-meeting, and taken part in its proceedings. One
evening the following winter the mother came to the
house of the teacher in a most pitiable condition. As
she stood at the door without bonnet or shawl, and
partly covered with snow, her face bore an expression
of abject misery. In her hand she held a letter, and the
big tears stood in her eyes. It was evident that her
grief was too deep for utterance, so her friend took the
letter from her hand, and glancing through it found that
it was from the colour-sergeant of the regiment, to say
"that her son, his comrade and Christian friend, had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
died of fever, after four days' illness, and that his end
was perfect peace." The poor stricken one was taken
into the kitchen and seated before the fire, a cup of tea
being made for her. When warmed and refreshed, her
friend spoke comforting words, and then they sought the
soothing influence of prayer. An hour after she went
out into the cold and snow much comforted, and muttering
to herself about her "Eddy" and heaven. From
that time her frame bowed, her hearing became heavy,
and her health gradually gave way. At times she was
an annoyance to her friend, as he had evidently taken
the place of her son in her affections. Strange-looking
object as she was, she used to call upon him at most
unseasonable times. As her health failed these visits
became less frequent, and in her last illness they were
returned. Before her death, which was very recent, the
patient labourer was rewarded for his efforts of many
years to lead her to the Saviour, as she clung to Him
with all the fervour of a simple faith. To the last she
kept her foolish oath, for she did not for thirty years
wear either bonnet or shawl.</p>

<p>"Saved in a London Court, and gathered into the
Heavenly Mansions from India," is the epitome of the
young convict's spiritual history: and as if to illustrate
the fact that London is the great heart of the world, an
Indian who was met with in that very Court, was drawn,
gave the life-look to the Uplifted One, and from the
empire city joined the "great multitude of all nations,
and kindred, and people, and tongues." It thus occurred,&mdash;</p>

<p>Upon his entering the Court one morning, the
Missionary noticed a little Indian girl, who was surrounded
by a number of other children. She was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
about eight years of age, of dark yellow complexion,
with jet black hair, which hung over her shoulders,
and upon her wrists were thick silver bracelets. Upon
questioning her, the child with peculiar accent, said that
she came with her parents from Bombay; that her
father was a cook, and had come to London to make
pickles at a large shop; and that they had come to live
in the Court until her father and mother got to work.
He went to the room with the child, and there saw the
father, a pure Indian, dressed like a Lascar. There was
only a hammock-like mattress, and some ship's utensils
in the room. Upon the mantel-shelf were many bottles
of curry powder, and a small idol of white ivory, which
seemed to represent a boy with the head of an elephant.
As the Visitor started a conversation about the business,
he became communicative, and stated that he was a
native of Hyderabad, but had lived for many years in
Bombay, where he became cook to a British sahib, and
afterwards was employed to make pickles for export
to England. He was reluctant to talk about religion,
but said that Vishnu and Ganesa were great and powerful
gods; that he had married a half-caste woman,
whose mother was a Mohammedan, and whose father
was an English sailor, and now kept a lodging-house for
sailors at Bombay; that the bracelets upon the wrists
of his child were made of silver coins which bore the
image of his mother's god, and she had placed them on
the child when she was an infant. He added, "that
he thought his wife was a Christian, but that she had
respect to Ganesa, and that he did not like his child to
be a Christian, as they got drunk and broke up the
gods." When the one <i>Great God</i> was mentioned he
looked anxiously towards his idol, as though he feared<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
that it would be injured or taken from him; and then he
muttered so loudly in a strange tongue, that the visitor
thought it well to leave.</p>

<p>A few days after the Missionary was told that the
Indian was ill, and he at once went in to see him. He
found him so bad, that he went out and fetched a
medical friend, whose prescription gave immediate
relief. That evening the heathen listened for the first
time to a simple statement concerning Jehovah; His
works, His mercy, and the atonement accomplished at
Jerusalem for the sin of the world. As he was worse
next morning, his friend obtained an indoor letter for
the Middlesex Hospital, and removed him there in a
cab. He remained under treatment for nearly two
months, during which time he was visited thrice a week,
and thoroughly instructed in the Christian faith. When
discharged he did not return to the Court in which he
had lived only a fortnight, as his wife had arrived, and
had taken a room near some of their country people in
Drury Lane. As he expressed contempt for idols, and
a desire for salvation, he was introduced to the Missionary
of the district, who paid him great attention, and
brought several clergymen to instruct him. One day he
ran after his old friend, whom he saw in Holborn, and
exclaimed, "Oh, sahib, God in heaven is so great, and
Jesus is our Saviour here!" This confession gave joy
to his friend, who returned with him to his lodging, and
was pleased to find that the Indian and his wife had
become regular in their attendance at church. After a
conversation about baptism, the Missionary took hold of
the bracelet of their little girl, who from the time he
entered the room had sat with her hand in his, and
said, "These heathenish ornaments ought not to remain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
upon the wrists of your child, now that you are Christians."
"Take them off, sahib," replied the father:
"they are much money, and a present from my heart
to you." A few days after the Missionary and his wife
drew them open with a towel, and he has them now
among other precious memorials of Christian work. Arrangements
had been made for the baptism of the
Indian, when he was taken suddenly ill; that sacrament
was however administered by a curate of St. Giles'
Church. He lived some months after this in great
suffering, but he rejoiced in God his Saviour, and fell
asleep in Him. As the mother was poor, with two
younger children, and as the girl was exposed to much
evil in that low neighbourhood, the Missionary placed
her in a "rescue Home." She grew up a pleasant
Christian girl, and went to service. When she last
called upon her friend, all was well with her.</p>

<p>The young convert from infidelity, like others who
had received spiritual good, left the place for more
respectable lodgings. He became diligent in his attendance
upon the means of grace, and by application to
his trade and a good use of his leisure, he qualified
himself for a better position. He formed a class of
young men, who styled themselves "The Bible Defence
Club," of which the Missionary became president. They
met weekly to read and converse upon the evidences,
and by arrangement took part in the infidel discussions.
As the result, several leading sceptics became converted,
and the opinions of the working men of the neighbourhood
were so influenced, that the infidel club broke up, and their
discussion "forum" became so thinly attended that it also
came to an end. This was a great victory and cause for
gratitude. The young convert had an uncle who was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
manager of a large firm in one of the midland towns; he
was so pleased with his nephew's letters, that he offered
him employment, which was gladly accepted. He rose
rapidly, and a few years after, when he came to London
on the business of the firm, he had become so much
the gentleman that his friend scarcely knew him. Soon
after his appointment as manager of a "department" he
married a Christian woman, but he continued to sing
in the Church choir, and to teach in the Sunday-school.</p>

<p>These abiding cases have given joy to the Christian
worker, and helped to sustain him in still more onerous
duties. They are, however, few when compared with
the disappointments. At the time of the revival in the
Court there was much blossom, as the inquiry for salvation
was general; but when fruit was sought for, it
was plain that a spiritual blight had passed over the
place, destroying much good. The "omnibus-washer,"
for instance, became confirmed in infidelity, resisted
every good influence, and died in a hopeless state; his
wife became a drunkard, and his eldest children came
to ruin. The "'strology woman" prospered upon the
wages of iniquity, and became queen of a London den.
Besides these, the Missionary used frequently to meet
with those of whose salvation he once had hope, standing
in the way of sinners, and sitting in the seat of the
scornful. He has indeed met with bitter opposition
from several over whom he once had spiritual influence.
Perhaps in so real a conflict as this with the powers of
darkness, such failures are to be expected; they, however,
have a humbling tendency, and lead to simple resting
upon the promises, as they prove that the instrument
by itself is of little worth,&mdash;that souls are won, not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
by might, nor by power, but by the Spirit of the Lord.
The one consolation, however, in these discouragements,
is the fact that we never know when the Word which
has been faithfully spoken will germinate. It may be
years after, and in the day of the Lord many a joyous
surprise may be experienced at finding unknown cases
in which grace has triumphed.</p>

<p>Even here the "works following" past labours are
causes of joy, and to complete this narrative three shall
be recorded.</p>

<p>When he first entered the Place, the Missionary was
resisted by a besotted man and his wife. He was
deputy potman, or rather "hanger-on" at a gin bar, in
which he used to stand for many hours daily. His wife
did cleaning and odd jobs for the lower class of tradespeople,
and was in dissipation a fit companion for her
husband. He was taken ill, and the long-sought-for
opportunity to read and reason with them was obtained;
the poor man professed penitence, sank rapidly, and
died. In her early widowhood the woman sought and
found mercy. She left the Court, became a communicant,
and has ever since been regular in her attendance
at the Lord's table. She is now of advanced growth in
grace, and occasionally calls upon her old friend, and
they have sweet converse together about matters concerning
the kingdom of heaven.</p>

<p>Something was gained for the right when the little
Frenchman, who lived at No. 10, became subdued and
attentive. Since his escape from Paris, twelve years
before, he had taken up his abode in the "Grove," and
forgetting his own tongue, he had learned to speak the
slang language of the Court "like a native." He lived
by polishing cheap furniture, and he was regarded by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
many of his neighbours as an amusing acquaintance.
His opinions and his life were bad, as he expressed
hatred toward ministers and professors of religion, and
his tongue was so corrupt that some of the people (sunk
as they were in ignorance and sin) avoided him. When
met with by himself he was quietly and patiently instructed
in the doctrines of the pure religion; but when
met with among others he was put upon the defence
of his low infidel sayings and his wrong living. He at
length used to fix his gaze upon the Bible, when taken
from the side-pocket, and listened as one who felt its
power. He was once arrested by the beatitudes, and
asked several times to have them read to him. All we
can say more about him is that his bad influence became
neutralized, and that his soul received some rays
from the light of the revealed word.</p>

<p>The other is only part of a narrative, as it concerns
our amusing acquaintance, "Black Poll." At first her
conduct in the "Home" was wild and unruly, but as the
civilizing process went on, she proved the truth of that
saying of the ancients that "the wildest colts make the
best horses, if only they are properly broke in." She
was properly broke in, and developed a fine character.
Quick in learning and diligent in work, she became a
favourite with the ladies and the matron. She was of
pleasant countenance and of marked neatness in her
dress, so there was no difficulty in providing for her
after she had been nearly four years in the "Home."
She was received into a good family as under-nurse,
and did extremely well, being much valued by her
mistress and loved by the children. Unhappily for her,
"Uncle Dusty" regarded her with enduring affection;
upon obtaining her address, he stopped one evening with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
his company before the mansion where she lived, and
told the footman that "he knowed 'Poll' lived there, as
was a credit to him, becos he jist made a woman on her
by taking her out of the workus." The family were
annoyed, and the girl felt degraded before her fellow-servants,
and came next day to consult with the friend who
had rescued her. As she had thought of emigrating to
Canada with other young people for whom kind arrangements
had been made, she was advised to do so. Upon
arriving in the colony she obtained a good situation, and
at intervals of time sent many pleasant and thankful
letters to her "Home" friends in London. The last of
these was to him who has in the providence of God
wrought out so great a deliverance for her. In it she
informed him that she was about to be married to a
young man with good prospects, and concluded with
these touching words: "When, sir, you met me on the
stairs God placed his banner over me, and ever since it
has been love, and I shall always be your grateful girl,
M. W."</p>

<p>Yes; the banner of a Saviour's love was placed over
her, and over the old Court, when the Christians of
Tunbridge Wells sent a messenger of the Cross to its
people; and that banner of crimson hue still floats over
them, and the restoring work goes on, as the improved
condition of the place and people clearly testify. There
are, however, in that neighbourhood of Lisson Grove,
though situate in the western part of the capital of
Christian England, a vast multitude who are uninfluenced
by the law of the spirit of life in Christ Jesus, and
many of whom are deeply sunk in ignorance and sin.
Ten missionary districts are unvisited, though each contains
upwards of two thousand precious souls. Christian<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
tradesman of the Edgeware Road, who are well acquainted
with the spiritual necessities of the "Grove,"
have formed themselves into a committee to provide for
three of those districts. They need help. The writer,<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>
who is responsible for the support and extension of
missionary work in this part of London, will gladly
receive communications concerning giving and receiving.
He is persuaded that many who read this narrative will
gladly share in the joy of conveying the Gospel to this
multitude of precious souls; that many will help to raise
the banner of love over these acres of habitations so
thickly peopled with the home heathen; that a blessing
may rest upon our nation by an increase of its
people who love righteousness, and who can enter with
personal zest into the sweet language of the poet
Weitzel:&mdash;</p>

<p class="cap_1">YOU see, master, as how it can't be no otherwise;
my poor husband is very ill, and cos
it's consumption he can't live long. I has
to go out a-selling to get us a living, and he
is miserable all by hisself. Now, though I
says it myself, he is very much respected by
the landlord and all as uses this house, and he always
enjoys hisself here. So they have put the two large
barrels at each side of the little one, and before I goes
out I takes him and puts him down comfortable, as in an
arm-chair, and then his pals gives him sups of rum, and
that sort of thing, and it does him lots of good&mdash;and he
shan't be without his enjoyments for the like of you."</p>
</div>

<p>The latter part of this speech was delivered in a defiant
tone. The speaker was the wife of a costermonger
who lived in a neighbouring court. The person addressed
was the Missionary of the district, who had, by
a kind touch of the arm and a cheerful "How are you
to-day?" arrested their hurried entrance into a gin-palace.
The man was about thirty years of age, and as he leaned
against the marbled pillar of the "palace," supporting
himself upon his stick, he presented a pitiable sight.
The loose-fitting jacket, the sunken eyes, the hectic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
flush upon the cheek, and hard breathing, indicated
his near approach to the grave. A few words of gentle
reproof and concern for his spiritual safety only provoked
a movement by which he was partly supported
and partly pushed into the bar.</p>

<p>As the massive door with its ground-glass panels
closed upon them, an expression of sadness passed over
the face of the Missionary. He had just entered upon
the work, and for the first time realized in its intensity
the "burden of souls." Only a few weeks before, the
Committee of the London City Mission had said to
him, "Visit the inhabitants of the district assigned you,
for the purpose of bringing them to an acquaintance
with salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ, and of
doing them good by every means in your power." The
court in which these persons lived was within the district,
and it was his duty to seek the salvation of that man.
As he passed on, he thus reasoned with himself: "If I
make no effort for his good, he must be lost; but what
can I do? When I called in at his room last evening,
he was stupefied with liquor, and it will be the same
to-night. He is sober now; why should I not visit
him in the bar, and deal faithfully with him?" After
prayerfully pondering the matter, he turned back
and timidly entered the "palace." The woman had
left, but the man was there in the position described
by her. The small barrel was so placed between
the two large ones as to form a comfortable seat.
Several men of his own class were standing by him,
and though early in the day, groups of gin-drinking
men and women had assembled in the four compartments
into which the bar was divided. The floor had
been swept and covered with sawdust, which gave it a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
comfortable appearance, while its spaciousness and
highly-varnished hundred-gallon hogsheads, the gilded
frame-work of the plate-glass panelling, the bright rows
of wine and spirit bottles, and the active movements of
the landlord and two barmen, rendered the place attractive
and pleasant to the miserably clad customers.</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 486px;">
<img src="images/i151.jpg" width="486" height="500" alt="Man speaking to other men in bar" title="Speaking to Men in the Bar" />

</div>

<p>The sick man was evidently startled by the appearance
of the visitor, who set him at ease by observing, "You
must have plenty of time for reading, so I thought I
would call and give you some interesting little books
which I intended to have left in your room."</p>

<p>Several were then handed to him, and accepted with
the remark, "I can't read much, but I'll ask the chaps
what reads the papers to read them to me."</p>

<p>The men who were standing round asked for tracts<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
and then listened with deep interest while the Missionary
repeated the parable of the builders. Only a few remarks
were made upon it, when the landlord in an angry
tone assured the visitor that, "They were not natural
fools, to believe a set of lies made up by the Jews."</p>

<p>"The words I have repeated," was the calm reply,
"were uttered by the Saviour of the world in mercy
to sinners. Believe them, and your soul shall live."</p>

<p>By this time the customers had gathered from the
other compartments, attracted by the novelty of religious
teaching in such a place. The landlord spoke
quietly to several men who were standing near the bar,
and immediately after one of them made his way towards
the Missionary, and tore the leaves of a tract,
formed them into paper lights. He lit his own pipe
with one of them, observing in derision,&mdash;</p>

<p>"These here are useful things, guv'nor, to light up
with: give us some more."</p>

<p>A general laugh was suppressed by the prompt
answer,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Of course I will, as they are useful things. I have
given enough already to light you all up,&mdash;that is, in
the right way; and I'll give you some more, and tell
you what I mean. Now, there are some people who are
always in the dark, because they are blind; and there
are some people who are always dark in their souls.
They don't see with their minds the beautiful things
that are in the Bible, so they live badly, just as if there
was no God. That's a miserable way of living; and
when they are taken ill they are afraid to die, because
the grave is a dark place to go to. Now, if a man reads
these tracts, and thinks about what he reads, he will
light up his soul. Why, at the end of this tract there is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
a little bit out of the Bible which would do it for all of
you: 'Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners.'
When a man believes that, he becomes sorry for his
sins, and asks God for pardon, because Jesus died upon
the cross for him. He is then forgiven, and by the Holy
Spirit of God made good and happy. He has then no
fear of death, because he is certain of being in heaven
with the Saviour for ever."</p>

<p>Further remarks were prevented by the landlord, who,
forcing his way through the crowd of eager listeners,
seized the speaker by the arm, and with an oath thrust
him into the street. And thus ended the first missionary
visit to the public-houses.</p>

<p>A few days after the wife of the costermonger came
up to the Missionary, who was passing the court, and
said, "Please, master, my poor husband wants to be
religious; he says that he is all dark, and he wants to
hear some reading, and I've got no learning; and he has
not been in the bar, as he thought maybe that you
would call."</p>

<p>"I will see him at once," was the reply; and the
Christian visitor stepped with her into the room.</p>

<p>Before a word of greeting could be uttered, the poor
man exclaimed, with all the eagerness of one in spiritual
distress, "Sir, I have been dreadful wicked in my time,
and it's dreadful to be ill, and I don't know what
prayers to say."</p>

<p>The visitor looked with pity into the careworn, pallid
face of the all-but-dying man, and, taking a seat by his
side, told him in simple words the wondrous and soothing
story of a Saviour's love, and before leaving taught
him a few sentences of prayer. Such visits were repeated
daily, as the increasing weakness of the sufferer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
showed that the time for instructing him in the way of
salvation was short indeed.</p>

<p>Upon the last of these visits he listened with absorbing
interest to the narrative of the Lord's ascension,
and then, with a smile of peace, exclaimed, "He died for
poor me, and He has made it all right now, and I shall
go up to Him."</p>

<p>That night he passed away; and it was for some
time the talk of the Court that he died happy, because
he was made a Christian in the public-house.</p>

<p>One evening, about thirteen months after this event, a
crowd of persons, among whom were many of the respectable
inhabitants, stood around the gin-palace in
earnest conversation. It was so unlike the noisy crowds
which assembled when drunkards were ejected, that the
Missionary, who was passing, inquired the cause.</p>

<p>"The landlord has broken a blood vessel," was the
reply: "three doctors are with him, and we are waiting
to know the result."</p>

<p>Upon its being stated that the doctors gave hope of
his recovery, the people separated. For days it was
rumoured that his life was in danger, and at the little
mission service held in the Court, prayer was made on
his behalf. Several mornings after, the Missionary inquired
of the servant, who was standing at the private
door, as to the state of her master's health.</p>

<p>"A little better," she replied; "but he is still in the
club-room, as the doctors say it will be dangerous to
remove him for some days."</p>

<p>Acting upon the impulse of the moment, the Missionary
passed the servant, and with an ejaculatory
prayer for success, ascended the stairs, and tapped at
the club-room door.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span></p>

<p>"Come in," said a faint voice; and the visitor entered
and saw the landlord lying upon a couch, near the
fire.</p>

<p>Stepping gently forward, he said in a subdued tone,
"I must ask you, sir, to forgive this act of apparent
rudeness. The truth is, that since hearing of your illness
I have been praying for you."</p>

<p>There was a momentary embarrassment, until the
patient, with a troubled expression of face, whispered,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Who asked you to pray for me? I don't believe in
theology."</p>

<p>"No one asked me," was the reply; "but if you will
keep from speaking, which may retard your recovery, I
will, in a few words, tell you why prayer was made to
God in your behalf. After years of Bible-study I know
its statements to be true; and then I have tested its
promises, and know the blessings to be real. You, perhaps,
from want of opportunity, have not done the one,
and are therefore without the blessings now that you
most need them. I have felt as anxious about you as
though you had been an old friend; and we have prayed
that your life may be spared, and your soul saved."</p>

<p>"It's no use: I can never believe," was the reply;
but it was delivered so feebly, and with such an expression
of mental and physical pain upon the countenance,
as to draw forth emotions of sympathy.</p>

<p>"Permit me," said the visitor, "to repeat two passages
of Scripture, and then I will leave you: 'Let this mind
be in you, which was also in Christ Jesus: who being in
the form of God, thought it not robbery to be equal
with God; but made Himself of no reputation, and
took upon Him the form of a servant, and was made in
the likeness of men; and being found in fashion as a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
man, He humbled Himself, and became obedient unto
death, even the death of the cross. Wherefore God also
hath highly exalted Him, and given Him a name which
is above every name; that at the name of Jesus every
knee should bow, of things in heaven, and things in the
earth, and things under earth; and that every tongue
should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of
God the Father.' 'This is a faithful saying, and worthy
of all acceptation, that Christ Jesus came into the world
to save sinners.'" Placing his pocket Bible upon the
table, with the passage turned down, the visitor took
the hand that was offered to him, and said, "I will leave
my card: send to me as a friend whenever you please;
and may you find peace in the love of Jesus."</p>

<p>During the conversation, the wife had entered, and
following the visitor out of the room, thanked him for
calling. "I was religious once," she observed; "but
years before the bar has ruined me altogether; you cannot
do a first-class gin trade and keep religious."</p>

<p>The old question about the profit of gaining the world
and losing the soul was put to her, and so they parted.</p>

<p>Three mornings after, the potman called at the Missionary's
house with the message that his master wished
to see him as soon as he could call in.</p>

<p>"Thank you for coming," was the greeting with which
the landlord received the visitor, who had hastened to
obey his request: "I want to ask you to forgive me for
treating you so badly when you came into the bar to
see the poor fellow who was ill. I was in liquor&mdash;that's
how I came to do it."</p>

<p>"Don't think of that," was the reply; "besides, I
made excuse for you, as it was a strange thing for me
to enter your bar and talk about religion."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span></p>

<p>"It was," he replied; "but after the man was dead,
the widow used to tell us that he died so happy; and I
have often thought that you then acted as though you
believed the Gospel to be true, because following him
into my bar was seeking the lost sheep, and no mistake."</p>

<p>This introduced the subject of the internal evidence
of the Bible; and the visitor, after reading portions of
the fifth chapter of 2 Corinthians, commented on the
words, "If any man be in Christ, he is a new creature;"
showing that among the pillars of evidence which support
the Bible is the experience of the fact that all who
exercise saving faith in the Lord Jesus become the possessors
of a sealed peace, and prove by holy living the
change of the inner nature.</p>

<p>This visit was the commencement of a friendship
between the Christian teacher and the publican, who
remained ill for several months. His sceptical objections
to the truth were examined and gradually removed;
while the constant reading of that Word, the entrance
of which into the soul gives light, gradually wrought a
change in his views and feelings. He made no profession
of religion, but the change was apparent to all who
knew him. He overcame the habit of profane swearing,
and showed an interest in good things. His presence in
the bar effected a change in the character of the house.
He not only checked blasphemous and bad language,
but he refused to serve persons who were in liquor, and
would not allow mothers with infants in their arms to
stand in the bar. The visits of the Missionary were
encouraged. After conversation with the family, he
used to go into the serving-bar for conversation with the
men; and after that visited the four compartments used<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
by customers, reasoning with them about righteousness,
temperance, and a judgment to come. This teaching
was blessed to souls, as a desire to know the truth was
manifested by several of the worst characters in the
neighbourhood. They used to accept the invitation to
come and hear the Scriptures read in a room down the
court, and as the gracious result, several became converted.
Amongst these were two drunken women, who
used to boast of the number of times they had been
locked up; a youth of eighteen who had lived by thieving;
and a journeyman shoemaker.</p>

<p>The good influence was increasing in the publican's
family, when he was suddenly taken ill, and it became
evident that his sickness was unto death. He lingered
for some time in great weakness, but was happy in the
love of God. Shortly before his death, he said to the
Missionary, "I have settled my affairs, as I have no
hope of recovery; and now I have to ask a great kindness
of you: it is that you will promise me to take a
friendly interest in my wife and children when I am
gone." Upon the promise being given, he added, "I
should like, for my comfort, to receive the sacrament of
the Lord's Supper, because I have renounced my infidelity,
and am trusting for salvation to the blood-shedding
and merit of the risen Jesus."</p>

<p>A few hours after, the Rector and the Missionary
entered the gin-palace, and passing into the sick-chamber,
commemorated with the dying publican that offering of
Himself by which the Redeemer procured for His disciples
a present salvation and victory over death and
the grave.</p>

<p>After the solemn service, the Minister entered the
bar-parlour, and remained for some time, observing with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
deep interest the attention paid by various groups of
customers to the instruction of the Missionary. As they
left together, he remarked, thoughtfully, "While you
were in the bar, the landlady told me that, besides being
the means of her husband's salvation, you have reformed
some of the worst men and women who used to support
the house. This is grappling with the greatest evil in
my parish, and God is blessing the effort. I wish that
all such houses in the parish were thus visited."</p>

<p>"Your desire, sir, shall be carried out as far as the
district under my visitation is concerned," was the
reply.</p>

<p>The aged clergyman, taking the hand of the lay
visitor, said with emotion, "May the divine blessing
make the effort powerful, that the Redeemer's work may
be extended amongst these multitudes of the spiritually
dead."</p>

<p>The landlord lived about a fortnight after commemorating
the Lord's death, and his end was peace.
Only a few hours before his entrance into rest, he requested
that this Scripture might be engraved upon
his tombstone: "When Christ, who is our life, shall
appear, then shall ye also appear with Him in glory."</p>

<p>A year had scarcely passed when the widow was
compelled to leave the business, and she went to live in
another part of London. She rapidly sank from affluence
to extreme poverty. Hearing of her condition
the Missionary sought her out, and was saddened to find
her in a back kitchen at the East-end of London. He
took her two little girls, aged eight and ten years, home
with him, and through the kindness of leading men in
the trade, obtained their admission into the Licensed
Victuallers' School. Employment was obtained for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
widow as sick-nurse, and she has since lived a useful
and Christian life.</p>

<p>While visiting this family the following circumstances
occurred, which gave the Missionary influence with
several licensed victuallers and their customers.</p>

<p>The potman at a very low public-house just by was
taken seriously ill, and the landlord, upon hearing that a
Christian man had visited another house, sent to inquire
for him, and then wrote a note, asking him to call and
see his man. The visit was paid, and was succeeded by
others, until the young man recovered. The landlord
and his wife were thankful for the attention paid,
and upon each call asked him into their private room.
This led to an intimacy so close that he was consulted
both as to their religious and business difficulties: these
can be best explained in their own words, as the visitor
was seated with them one afternoon. "You see, sir,"
said the landlord, "that I can tell you anything, as you
are not like the religious and teetotal sort of people who
talk and write against us, but never call upon us, that
they may understand our position. Now I don't want,
and thousands in the trade don't want, to make or to
serve drunkards. In our last house we lost nearly all
the money my wife and I saved in a long service; but
if I had pandered to vice, we might have been there now.
While trying to make the house respectable, we lost
'takings' from the depraved and drunken, and, as the
result, were not able to meet demands, and were obliged
to leave and take this still lower class of business. The
truth is, that publicans, as a respectable body of tradesmen,
need sympathy and Christian influence, instead of
abuse, which only worries and makes us, in self-defence,
resist rather than assist in the necessary reforms; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
then, as our trade is a temptation, we need religious influences
in our families: but no clergyman has ever
entered my house. I have gone wrongly, as I have
taken to 'sipping,' but it's hard to bear up against the
trials I have had to pass through." "When we married,"
added the wife, "we had 200, and felt that we should
do well in this business; the Sunday trade has however
made me wretched. During the fourteen years I was
lady's maid I went to Church twice every Sunday; and
from that happy life to serving behind a bar is a dreadful
change. This is not needful except for two hours at
meals, when the necessary article of consumption could
be supplied; and then the rows in the tap are a constant
misery to me, and I wish we were out of the business
altogether."</p>

<p>"You have my deepest sympathy," said the Missionary,
"and I will advise you as a true friend. Your constant
drinking, landlord, must be stopped, or you will be
brought to an early grave, with the curse pronounced
against the drunkard resting heavily and for eternity
upon you. As regards your wife, it is wrong to expose
her to the misery which a woman of Christian feeling
must endure in this class of house. My advice is, get
out of it. You might save sufficient from the wreck to
take a small general shop, and you could then get a
connection as a waiter among your old acquaintances.
The great matter in this difficulty, as in all our trials, is
prayer: this you have both neglected. Inquire of the
Lord, and He will direct you."</p>

<p>A fortnight after this conversation the landlord and
Missionary met the agent of the firm to which the
business belonged, and an equitable arrangement was
made for giving up the house. Upon leaving the trade<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
they took a small grocer's business, and became Church
members, and prospered in their new calling.</p>

<p>Another publican, who was met with in this house,
spoke strongly against the Sunday business.</p>

<p>"Grumbling is of little use in such matters," observed
the visitor. "Act: get up a petition asking Parliament
to close you entirely upon the Lord's-day, and request
one of your Members to present it. A movement of
this kind in the trade would be much to your own and
to the public good."</p>

<p>"If sir," he replied, "you will write out the petition, I
will sign it, and go round with you to other members of
the trade, to obtain signatures."</p>

<p>The request was complied with, and forty licensed
victuallers signed the petition for entire Sunday closing,
and it was duly presented.</p>

<p>The arresting power of the Word of God was frequently
witnessed in these gin bars. For instance:
a woman one evening who entered the "Globe," and
called for her first dram, was arrested by the reasoning
of the missionary with some labourers. Approaching
him, pewter measure in hand, she exclaimed, "You
have no business here; go out, or I will throw this over
you." The men pushed her away, but he said kindly,
"Before you do so, let me say something to you out
of this Book," and then, after a pause to find a suitable
passage, he read distinctly, "Thus saith the Lord that
made thee ... I will pour water upon him that
is thirsty, and floods upon the dry ground. I will pour
my Spirit upon thy seed, and my blessing upon thine
offspring." Only a few words of comment were uttered,
when the woman placed the measure upon the bar, and
raising her apron to her eyes, burst into tears, and left,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
exclaiming, "Oh that I was a little girl again!" She
did not taste the gin, and was never after met in a
bar. It was evident that an arrow of conviction had
sped forth from the Word of God, but with her as with
thousands of others, its ultimate effect was not known.
Encouragement, this, for earnest labour and simple
trust in the power and promised blessing upon the
proclamation of God's mercy in Christ; yes, upon the
utterance of every truth contained in His own inspired
Word.</p>

<p>Opportunities frequently occurred for seeking the
good of customers as well as landlords, and these led
the Missionary to the conviction that the public-house
is a very proper sphere for Missionary operations. The
following is one instance. Upon passing a public-house
in his district rather late one evening, the visitor noticed
a woman near the door who had evidently been crying,
and she had an infant in her arms. When he spoke to
her she told him that her husband had just gone into the
tap-room with all the money they had, and she was afraid
to follow him, as he would knock her about if she did.</p>

<p>"Wait here," said the visitor; and then he entered the
house, and passed into the tap. It was filled with low
men, several of whom appeared confused at his seeing
them there. He however addressed one of them in a
friendly manner, and said, "You men had better be
careful; there is some one outside."</p>

<p>"Who can it be!" exclaimed several of the men,
looking uncomfortable.</p>

<p>"A White Sergeant," was the reply, and the announcement
produced a roar of laughter. To explain
the reason of the merriment a digression is necessary.
Well, then, a "White Sergeant" in the tap-room parlance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
is a wife who fetches her husband out of the
public-house. This is considered a great offence, and
men who submit to such an exercise of "women's
rights" are much joked at by their companions. Many
of the quarrels between husband and wife result from
this cause. One Monday morning, in a court he visited,
the Missionary saw five women with black eyes, all
received through efforts to get their husbands home with
their full week's wages. The announcement that a
"White Sergeant" was waiting for one of them outside
was therefore considered a capital joke.</p>

<p>As soon as their merriment had subsided, the visitor
said gravely, "And this 'White Sergeant' is a woman
of whom any man might be proud&mdash;pleasant-looking
and neat in her dress, with a dear little baby in her
arms; and in my opinion the man who would bring
such a woman to cry outside a public ought to hang his
head for shame."</p>

<p>The selfishness of men who for their own pleasures
would act in this way, was enlarged upon, until a man
rose and quietly left the room. A few tracts were distributed,
and then the visitor also went out, and saw the
man walking away with the "White Sergeant." He
approached them and spoke kindly to the man, saying
that he would like to call and give picture-books to his
children. In a surly way he was told that he might
"do as he liked," and he therefore went with them to
their door.</p>

<p>Next Sunday the visitor called, and after a pleasant
chat, opened the Bible to read to them, when one of the
children began to cry. The father, without saying a
word, took off his rough cap and threw it at the child
with such force as to knock it heavily upon the floor.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
The poor child crawled into a corner, and, from fear,
remained quiet. The parable of the Prodigal Son was
read, and the man was deeply interested in it, and with
the exposition showing the love of the Father. As the
reader proceeded, the man looked kindly towards the
child, and then went and took it into his arms. The
visitor was pleased with this act, as it showed him that
the man could be influenced for good. As he was
leaving, the man addressed him thus,&mdash;</p>

<p>"You didn't know me, guv'nor, when you saw me in
the tap; but I knowed you as the chap as made my pal
religious, as I used to play pitch-and-toss with when a
boy, and used to go out on the drunk with after we got
to be men; and when I seed him a-dyin', said he to me
said he, 'Bob, get religion, as it ain't no good a-goin' on
bad, as Jesus Christ is our Saviour. And my old woman
will tell the tract man to have a say with you out of his
Book.' Well, when you comed into the tap in that 'ere
way, and talked sensible, thinks I, that's 'im, and it's my
Beck outside; so I misselled (slipped out), and shouldn't
mind if you made Beck and me religious, that I
shouldn't."</p>

<p>The meaning of the word "conversion" was explained
to him in simple language, and an appointment made
for further instruction. These visits were continued for
some months, and a marked change for the better had
taken place, until he one night yielded to temptation,
got drunk, and became worse than he had ever been
before. He stripped the house of every comfort, and all
the labour appeared to have been lost upon him. He
was, however, met with one afternoon when hawking
crockery, and induced to sign the pledge. This he kept
for three months, and again relapsed. His friend had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
come to the conclusion that his case was hopeless, when
he received an unexpected visit from the man.</p>

<p>"Please, mister," he said with some confusion, "I am
a-comin' to live right agin you. I seed a room with a
loft over a stable and I took it, and I shall feel strong
like bein' agin you, and shan't be near my pals as gets
me to drink. It 'tain't 'pertinent like, is it, my comin'
here?"</p>

<p>The poor man was commended for his strange but
wise resolution, and his friend called to see them very
frequently. As a result, the children were sent to a
Sunday school, and the man was seen in the free seats
at church, clean, but in his hawker's clothes. The
reformation went on with him, and he became sober
and well conducted. One morning he called upon his
friend, and said, "I never cared, sir, for my children, for
I was a drunkard, and I didn't know nuffin' of our souls
and religion, and Beck and I wants the young uns to be
christened, that we does, and we are goin to stick to
church like as if we was made new inside, as is religion."</p>

<p>A few days after this conversation the curate called
and instructed the parents and the elder children in the
Christian faith, and then he arranged for the baptism.
As the Missionary stood at the font with the six
children before him, he rejoiced and gave thanks because
of the change which had passed over the family.
The "White Sergeant" and the drunken hawker had
changed in every way since he saw the one crying
outside the public-house, and the other seated in the
tap-room. They remained in the neighbourhood for
several years, and were among the most respectable of
the poor.</p>

<p>In this marked way it pleased the great Head of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
Church&mdash;who is always gracious to His servants who
strive to win souls&mdash;to honour the effort made to secure
the salvation of the poor costermonger; and the leadings
of His providence also made it an open door by
which the Gospel has been made known to hundreds
of thousands of the London poor. The Missionary, in
accordance with his promise to the minister, commenced
the regular visitation of the fourteen public and beerhouses
upon the district. This was trying and difficult,
but good results were granted; and the Committee of
the London City Mission, after examining into the
work, requested him to visit all the public-houses in
a large parish, as his sphere of duty. Results were so
satisfactory that they appointed Missionaries to the
same class of houses in nine other parishes, and are
now making efforts to extend the work. It is pleasing
to know that in the bars, tap-rooms, and parlours of
3,450 out of the 10,340 licensed houses in London,
earnest effort is made for the spiritual enlightenment
of the men and women who frequent them. As the
gracious and known result, hundreds of these have been
reclaimed from drunkenness and other vices, and many
of them are members of Christian Churches. The influence
upon publicans, and through them upon the
trade, has been in many instances remarkable for good.
Some houses have been entirely closed; others upon the
whole of the Lord's-day; while the character of many
has been changed for the better. Bar and other servants,
who form a large and important class, have received
great benefits; not a few have been induced to leave
the business, and others have been fortified against its
temptations and snares. In addition to all this, there
is a large daily distribution of Gospel and Temperance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
tracts, while publications of a high Christian and moral
tone are pressed into circulation. It may, indeed, be
said that a new field for Christian enterprise was opened
by the discovery that it is <i>possible</i> to grapple with the
withering curse of drunkenness at its very fountain-head,
and so bring many hitherto unreached multitudes in
our great cities under the influence of Christian teaching.</p>

"Sir, did you ever walk along a street,<br />
A low back street, at night, where drunkards meet!<br />
Where the gin palace turns the night to day,<br />
And public-house and beer-shop line the way?<br />
Say, did you listen? What, sir, did you hear?<br />
Our English workmen were enjoying beer.<br />
Did the rude clamour come from happy men,<br />
Or wild beasts maddened, raging in their den?<br />
You heard the fiendish laugh, the oaths, the strife,<br />
The curses heaped upon a helpless wife;<br />
The wretched harlot's song, the drunkard's roar,<br />
The noisy fiddle and the rattling floor;<br />
You saw the ragged mother sick and pale,<br />
You heard the miserable infant's wail;&mdash;<br />
That was the Englishman's happy lot:<br />
That was the music to the poor man's pot:<br />
You heard it? Yes,&mdash;our workmen mad with drink!<br />
Something to make a sober Christian think!"<br />

<div class="drop">
<img src="images/idrop_t.jpg" alt="T" width="66" height="107" class="cap" />
<p class="cap_1">THE following advertisement, which appeared
in several of the daily newspapers, induced
the Missionary to pay a farewell visit to the
landlord and bar-servants:&mdash;</p>
</div>

<p>"<i>Gin Palace</i> for sale, in a good working
and gin-drinking neighbourhood; doing 240
a week over the bar: elegant and substantial
fittings. Terms moderate. Immediate possession,"
etc.</p>

<p>With this farewell purpose, the Christian visitor entered
the "bottle department" early upon the following
Sunday evening, but found the place so filled with
customers that neither the landlord nor bar-men had
a moment to spare. He therefore simply shook hands
with them, and arranged to call in during the quiet
hours of the following afternoon, and then commenced
evangelizing work among the people.</p>

<p>Three high partitions divided the bar into four
compartments; and, as is usual, there were separate
doors to each, so that the crowds of customers could
not see each other, though the noise of their converse
and disputes produced a war of words, and rendered
quiet conversation difficult. One would have thought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
that the private or "bottle department" would have
been the easiest to visit, as its name seemed to invite
the respectable order of drinkers. To some extent
this was the case, but a jury of bar-men would certainly
agree in the opinion that this sly part of the house,
into which so many well-dressed persons slip for their
drams, is the most lucrative and usually the most
crowded. Only a few weeks before, the visitor was
standing with a young man in a similar compartment,
when seven women, wives of working men, entered,
and called for a quart of gin with ale glasses. They
were laughing heartily at what they considered a happy
thought of one of their companions,&mdash;the clubbing
together for the purpose of ordering so large a quantity
of spirits: they were much disconcerted at the withering
rebuke they met with.</p>

<p>Upon the evening of our visit, eight or ten men
and women were present. One of these, a respectable
tradesman, rejected a tract with the remark, "I don't
want your religious nonsense, as I do the thing that's
right between man and man; and if I didn't I would
not be interfered with by other people in religious
matters, as I know what is right, and could do it."
"The clock there is going wrong," replied the visitor,
looking towards that very ornamental object, "and
because it's out of repair, it does not answer the purpose
for which it was made, as it is hours too slow.
Now the landlord will not attempt to repair it himself,
neither will he give it to a grocer or a bricklayer
for that purpose: he will no doubt send it to the man
who made it,&mdash;to a clockmaker who understands its
mechanism; he will clean and repair it, and then the
hands will go right. Well, it's just so with us men:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
when we do wrong it proves that we are unclean inside,
and out of repair, and it is no good trying to set ourselves
right, for we can't do it; or to get other people
to tinker at us, as they are sure to make us worse.
Our proper course of action is to approach our Almighty
Maker, with the prayer, 'Create in me a clean
heart, oh God, and renew a right spirit within me.'
When this is done, we go right, and glorify God in
our bodies and our spirits, which are His." After a
few words about the Fountain opened for sin and
uncleanness, the speaker passed out, leaving the people
with their eyes fixed upon the clock, and their thoughts
upon the Saviour.</p>

<p>In the next compartment about sixteen working men
had assembled, all of whom were sober. Several were
annoyed, as one of them said, at "being tackled in
such a place as that about religion." "Why, you are
all in the building trade," exclaimed the intruder, "and
if you listen to the words I repeat, and do them, you
shall be likened to wise men who built a house upon
a rock: 'And the rain descended, and the winds blew,
and beat upon that house; and it fell not: for it was
founded upon a rock.'" As the attention of the men
was arrested by the parable, it was repeated to the
end; and then, taking the Bible from his pocket, the
reader observed, "These are not my words: they were
spoken by the Lord Jesus Christ." "I knows a lot of
the Bible," said one of the men, "and He never talked
like that." "I've heard it before," retorted a companion,
"and it's there." "Yes: I am right," replied the man
with the Book; and then, leaning his back against the
bar, he read the parable through, in a clear, expressive
tone. He then looked up, and said kindly, "You are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
not building on this rock; if you were you would be in
the house of God, instead of this place."</p>

<p>"That's right!" exclaimed several, and three of them
followed him into the street. "I'll go next Sunday,"
said a carpenter. "And so will I," answered his companion,
a smith. "And I will meet you at this corner
and go with you," said the reader. This arrangement
was confirmed with hand-shaking; and the men went
thoughtfully towards their homes, the Missionary entering
the next compartment.</p>

<p>In this several groups of persons were standing together,
those near the door being sweeps, who, in honour
of the day, were partly washed. One of them, a young
man, said that his mother was ill and wanted some one
to pray with her. The visitor took down the address
and promised to call. While doing so his attention was
directed to several men of the "fancy," who were in loud
conversation about the difficulties of their calling. They
were attired in dirty fustians, with gaudy cotton handkerchiefs
round their necks, and caps which made their
foreheads appear "villanously low." One of them held
a bull-dog by a chain, and several puppies were peeping
out of the side pockets of his coat. He was evidently
the important man of the group, as his companions were
listening with respect to his grievances, which he expressed
in the following way: "This 'ere draining of
London will be the ruin of us, that it will. Why look
'ere: I've been all this blessed day a-trying to get six
dozen of rats, and I has only got two dozen; and it's
ruination the price of them is. I never grumbles at
buying them at fourpence each when they are fat and
lively like that, I doesn't, as it's a fair price; but it's
enough to make a chap go rampstairing when he has to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
tip a bob each, or eleven shillings a dozen for them, as I
did this afternoon; and it's this draining of London
does it, as they be slushed away. And then last week
I had a misfortune. I went out with my pal, as is
ratcatcher to the Queen, for two days' catchin' about
Windsor, and I left three dozen in the low pit. Well,
when I comes back, my misses, as as bin queer, said,
'Oh dear me, I forgot to feed the rats!' So I went off,
as I knowed how it 'ed be. When I looked in it a
dozen had gone, and they was a-eating ever-so-many
of one another; so I chucked in the stuff as had been
mixed up for 'em, and there was an end of their barbarities,
as rats are good-natured like when they has
plenty of grub; but when the price is up it is, as I say,
ruination."</p>

<p>"And so you have been all day trying to buy rats,
have you? a pretty way to be sure for a man to spend
his Sunday," observed the Missionary, as he turned
towards the man, and caressed a pretty little spaniel
whose head was resting upon the flap of his pocket.</p>

<p>"I has," was the sharp reply: "and I makes no
profession of religion, so it's no harm; like them saints,
one of which I knows as cheats you through thick and
thin; so I does the correct thing, and snaps my finger,
and says I, None of your religion for me."</p>

<p>"I see how it is," rejoined the visitor. "You have
met with an imitation Christian, a counterfeit, as we
call bad money, and for that reason you will not be a
real Christian. Is that what you mean? If so, it is
like saying, 'A man passed a bad shilling upon me, so
I never mean to take a good one.'"</p>

<p>"That's a puzzler," replied the man, thoughtfully;
"as I knows what good Christians are, as was my father<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
and mother, as was Welsh, like me. They did the right
thing by me; but I 'erd of people a-gettin' on in London,
so I ran away from them, and begged and stumped
it up here. And I got in with some young prigs in
Whitechapel, and got took before the beak, as wasn't
for much; and he didn't give a fellow a chance, but put
on three months hard; and when I got out I couldn't
get on, so I went out with a chap a-catchin' birds and
rats, and married his daughter. And now I has a bird
shop at Shoreditch, and a rat-pit, as was profitable afore
this 'ere draining was inwented, as gents bring their
dogs to be teached to kill rats first-rate, and sometimes
they has a match on the quiet; and they are gents as
does it and pays up, and says as I am the best rat-pit
man they knows."</p>

<p>In reply to questions, the rat-pit man admitted that
during the eighteen years he had been in London he
had only once been into a church, and that was at his
marriage. When reminded that he was the child of
many prayers, and of parents passed into the heavens,
he was softened, and said, "If I know'd somebody as
is religious, I should be better; but I doesn't know a
religious chap, that I doesn't."</p>

<p>"Give me your address," said the visitor, "and I will
ask a Missionary gentleman who lives near, a friend of
mine, to call upon you." This was done, and the parties
left the bar together.</p>

<p>The fourth compartment was crowded with persons
of the degraded and disorderly class, and it was evident
that several men in one corner were excited with liquor.
In the centre was a large barrel, and round it stood
three women. One of them had turned a quart pot
upside down upon the barrel, and had seated her little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
child, about a year old, upon it. She called for "a
quartern and three outs" (three glasses to divide the
liquor), when the Missionary, who felt the difficulty of
securing the attention of such a people, approached with
the exclamation: "Why, what do you think? When
the Saviour of the world was here, He took a little
child, a pretty little dear like that, and sat it in the
midst of His disciples, and said, 'Except ye be converted,
and become as little children, ye shall not enter into
the kingdom of heaven.'"</p>

<p>"Did He, sir?" exclaimed several.</p>

<p>"Yes: He did," was the reply; "and if you will
listen to me I will tell you what He meant."</p>

<p>At this the people gathered round the barrel, and the
speaker, taking the tiny hand in his, continued: "There
is no mistake about the love of a little darling like this.
When it throws its arms around your neck you know
it's real love" ("That it is," said the mother, giving the
child a hug); "and the Saviour meant that we men and
women, who are children of the great Father in heaven,
ought to love Him with all our hearts, and do His holy
will. Now I don't think that we all do this."</p>

<p>"I should think not," said a man with a coarse laugh.
"If we did, we shouldn't be a-getting drunk in here on
a Sunday night."</p>

<p>"You are right," replied the visitor. "You are not
like this pretty child; you are bad children, and must,
as Jesus said, be converted. The great Father loves
you, and sent His Son to tell you how to be made good,
and to die for your sins." Other words of exhortation
were being uttered, when the address was brought to
a close by another group of persons pressing into the
bar.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span></p>

<p>This consisted of an old woman, and three young men
of the <i>genus</i> rough. The woman, who had been crying,
and who had new weeds upon her head, was reluctant
to enter, as one of the men said to her, "Never mind,
mother; it's what we are all a-comin' to. He was a
good un, as respected was everywhere. Come in and
have a drop of rum."</p>

<p>"And have you been," inquired the Missionary, "to
bury the husband and the father?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," replied the widow, sobbing. "We was
married forty-two years, and it's his first night in the
cold grave, and I'm so miserable, and my boys has
brought me to give me some rum;" and then she sobbed
so deeply that the people looked at her with pity.</p>

<p>"Don't touch the rum," said the visitor, "but let me
go home with you and read from this blessed Book the
comforting words which the merciful God has said to
widows;" and then they stepped out of the bar, the sons
following. They entered a house a few doors further on,
and descended to the back kitchen, which was dismal,
and almost without furniture. Taking a seat on the
edge of the bedstead, the visitor read the account of the
widow of Zarephath, and such Scriptures as "The Lord
relieveth the fatherless and widow;" "Let thy widows
trust in Me;" and then explained to her the meaning of
being "a widow indeed." The young men were deeply
interested, but when prayer was offered they stood up
awkwardly, though the mother knelt; it was evident that
they had never bent the knee in supplication. After
more words of sympathy the widow was left much comforted,
and with the promise of another visit.</p>

<p>After this the Missionary passed through several other
public-houses with varied success, and scattered much<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
precious seed. As the evening was far advanced, he
entered a large beer-shop, intending a final visit. About
thirty men and women of the lower class were standing,
many of them with their backs to the walls, as the landlord
had removed the seats to prevent his customers
staying too long. Upon glancing round, the visitor
noticed a middle-aged man, whom he had not seen for
several years, and inquired of him where he had been?</p>

<p>"To prison, for assault upon a woman," he replied.
"I was committed for four years, and that wasn't much,
as she will never get over it; and I'm out six months
afore time with a ticket-of-leave; and it was the drink
as made me do it, as I wouldn't hurt nobody."</p>

<p>"It's no use laying it to the drink," was the reply;
"speak the truth, and say that it was your love of the
drink,&mdash;your vice that led you to commit the crime.
You may make excuse now, but the day is coming when
you will be tried again for that and for every offence of
your life, as we must all stand before the judgment seat
of Christ; now mind, if you are condemned by that
Judge there will be no escape from the prison of hell, to
which you will be sent."</p>

<p>At the commencement of this conversation, the door
swung open, and a man of a baser sort entered. He
listened; but brought the conversation to a sudden close
by clenching his fist, and with that malicious hiss which
bad men have, he addressed the Missionary, and said,
"What business has you in our shop, a-talking like that
'ere? for two pins I'd smash in your frontispiece."</p>

<p>The ticket-of-leave man frowned, and holding out his
right arm with extended finger and thumb gave a peculiar
jerk and exclaimed, "If you does I'll garotte you." And
a woman, whose sister the visitor had placed in a reformatory,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
fearing that he would be injured, rushed before
him with a half-scream. The rough, who was evidently
astonished at the good feeling which existed between
the Christian teacher and the persons of his own class,
stepped back; but as the attention of the debased crowd
in the bar was directed towards him, the visitor raised
his hand and said loudly, "Never mind: I am not hurt.
But it was just so hundreds of years ago, when the
Saviour of the world was here. He used to feed hungry
people, and heal the sick, and give eyesight to the blind;
but there were men who smote Him with the fist of
wickedness, and who cried out, 'Crucify Him, crucify
Him,' and then they nailed Him to a cross." The
speaker then dropped his voice to a solemn note, and
continued, "Yes; and&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">

<span class="i0">'It was for such as you He died,</span><br />
<span class="i0">For such that He was crucified,</span><br />
<span class="i0">For such He reigns above.'"</span><br />
</div>

<p>The effect was startling, as that congregation of the
wicked stood in silent awe; while the landlord and his
barmen leaned forward to listen. A few more earnest
words were uttered, and the evangelist stepped out,
wiping the perspiration from his brow. The rough at
almost the same moment passed out at the other door,
and approaching the Missionary, said, "I ax yer pardon,
guv'nor; but I wouldn't 'urt a hair of your 'ed."</p>

<p>"I feel all right toward you, so never mind," was the
kind reply, enforced with a friendly touch of the arm.
"You sees, guv'nor," the rough continued, "as I am a
bad un, as I had a month for beating my old woman,
and its becos I ain't hedicated, cos if a chap ain't hedicated
he's nuffin."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span></p>

<p>From this speech it was evident that the man had a
desire for instruction, and the visitor felt that to impart
this would give him a power which might lead to a
moral and spiritual regeneration; he therefore inquired
if he would like to know how to read and write?</p>

<p>"Oh, shouldn't I: that's all!"</p>

<p>"Well then, if you have the mettle in you to stick to
your book, which is hard work for a man of forty, I will
spend an hour with you once or twice a week, and teach
you."</p>

<p>The poor rough looked astonished, wriggled in a
strange manner, and then gave expression to his feelings,
by exclaiming, "If you does, master, when I gets into
work I'll treat you to a day in the country."</p>

<p>His friend could but smile at this singular ebullition
of grateful feeling, though he knew the force of its
meaning. To men like him, pent up in the density of
the mighty city, a day in the country is the greatest
conceivable enjoyment, and to promise that showed
that the man had a soul, and perhaps a latent taste for
the beautiful.</p>

<p>As it was necessary that the teacher should know
where the man lived, he went with him down one of
those narrow, dirty streets, where the people live in comfort
as regards thieves: as they have nothing to be
robbed of, they allow their doors to remain open all
night. The man entered one of these open doors, and
ascended the stair-case, in thick darkness; his step was
evidently known, as a woman came out of the back attic,
holding in her hand a blacking bottle, in which was a
piece of candle. All doubts as to her being his wife
was set at rest, by the rough introducing his new
acquaintance in the following elegant language, "'Ere<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
Sarah, 'ere's a gent I've picked up in a beer shop." To
the embarrassment of the dirty, ragged woman, the
visitor entered the room; and a deplorable room it was,&mdash;a
drunkard's home. The floor was dirty, without a piece
of carpet, and several of the panes of glass were broken
and pasted over with pieces of brown paper, greased to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
admit a little light. There was only one broken chair,
and a sieve-basket, covered with a rusty tea-tray, formed
another seat. The table was evidently the safest piece
of goods, as the wife invited her visitor to take a seat
upon it. There was no bedstead, but an accumulation
of rags in one corner covered two dirty little children.
The poor woman had that crushed and wretched expression
of face so common among the wives of this class of
men. A quarter of an hour's conversation set her at ease
and secured her good-will. Before leaving, the visitor,
who had taken his seat upon the table, opened his Bible
and read, while the woman stood with her light in the
blacking bottle on one side of him, and her brutal but
now subdued husband upon the other.</p>

</div>

<p>A few evenings after, the Missionary, as arranged,
entered the room with the spelling-book in his hand, to
give the first lesson, and was glad to find the rough at
home, and to return, with a pleasant smile, his gruff salutation
of, "Thought as how you wasn't a-coming; but
thank'ee, guv'nor, for doing on it." He then fairly seized
the Primer, and repeated the alphabet so vigorously, that
his intention of "being hedicated in no time" was evident,
even if he had not said so. The book was left with
him, and upon the next lesson-evening his wife told the
teacher that "Bill had bin a A-ing, and B-ing, and B A-ing,
ever since he com'd up there afore." Lesson succeeded
lesson for many weeks, and though the task was
distasteful to both parties, the rough got on exceedingly
well, and at the end of three months he was able to read
easy lesson books. From that time there was evidence
of a change passing over the family. The understood
rule of the London City Mission, that no visit be completed
without the reading or repeating of some portion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
of Holy Scripture, had been observed, and as the result,
much of that Word, the entering of which into the soul
gives light, had been read to this poor man and his wife.
There was a change in their home, for the teacher one
evening noticed two new chairs and a piece of carpet;
after this, several gaudy pictures and a fender were
introduced, and then the rags were removed, and a punch
and judy bedstead (a thing that turns up in the corner)
set up in its place.</p>

<p>"You are getting on in the world," observed their
friend one evening, as he glanced round the room.</p>

<p>The man looked unutterable things at his wife, and
said, "Should think we are, sir; and I'll let the cat out
of the bag, as they sayes: and this is that ere cat.
Arter you had been a-readin' and a-'elpin' me one night
I walks out, and as I passed the Tom and Jerry where
I picked you up, some old pals says, 'Come in and
have a little heavy wet!' and in I goes; and then we
went into the tother corner, and I stood some gin, as
with the tother got into my 'ed; and when I was turned
out I seed a Peeler, and wolunteered to fight 'im. So
he takes me by the choker and walks me along, and
my old woman, as was looking for me, comes up and
begged the Peeler not to trot me in, as makes a charge.
So, bein' soft 'arted, he gived me to her; and when I
got up 'ere I was sober like, and said I, I will be a
Christian, like as the gent reads of, what eat pigs'
wittles, and went back to his Father; and I'll be teetotal
to-morrow. So in the morning I had a pen'orth
of coffee at the total shop, and hopened my mind to the
gal what brought it; and she told the guv'nor, and he
brings a book, and I put a scratch in it, and I haven't
had a drop of the public stuff never since; and we said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
we'd say nothin' to you till we had been teetotal a
month, and it's more than that now."</p>

<p>The man was commended for his resolution, and
when the lesson was over, the Book was opened and
the parable of the Prodigal Son again read and more
fully explained, and then the family altar was set up
in that poor room, as the man with his wife and children
knelt together in prayer.</p>

<p>Soon after this the man obtained employment in a
timber yard, to empty sawdust from the pits, and his
improvement, indeed his uprising in the social scale,
became rapid. One evening his teacher took a very
dear friend to see him,&mdash;the talented author of "Our
Father's Care," and "Mother's Last Words." Reaching
a Bible from the chest of drawers (for they had risen
to that dignity), he said, "Do, mum, hear me read, as
I does it well like. When I seed that gent in a beer
bar I was a-goin' to smash at him, but he has learned
me to read first rate." He then read the fifth chapter
of St. Matthew's Gospel; and as the lady afterwards
remarked, "he read it well, as he seemed to feel the
force of every word." After this he gave evidence of
a renewed nature, and became a living proof that grace
can change a rough into a quiet and peaceable man,
and that it is possible to pluck bad men from among
the ungodly, as brands from the everlasting burning.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p><span class="smcap">Note.</span>&mdash;Eleven years have passed since Mrs. Sewell's
visit to the rough, and we take the opportunity of
revising for a new edition, to add that the man and his
wife have stood firm to temperance principles. It was
long, several years, before he joined a Congregational
Church, and like many such he was an unobtrusive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
member, but his life was right. The appearance of his
wife became so altered that she obtained work at
charing, and their home possessed an appearance of real
comfort. The eldest of the children, first seen on the
rags, a girl, has obtained a place as nursemaid in a
tradesman's family, and the rest bid fair to do well.
Renewed proof, this, of the power of the religion of the
Lord Jesus to convert the soul, to enforce holy living,
and to bless the rising generation. Why then should
any be lost for lack of knowledge? Why should not
all the people be instructed in the law of the Lord?
each individual receiving the call to repentance, faith,
and the blessed hope.</p>

<p class="cap_1">THIRTEEN years of Christian work in public,
coffee, and night-houses, during which time
465 Sunday evenings were spent in the bars,
taps, and parlours of these places, gave the
Missionary thousands of opportunities to
reason with men and women about righteousness,
temperance, and a judgment to come.
Incidents of interest were of constant occurrence, and
we select a few with the object of showing that the
sword of the Spirit, which is the Word of God, is mighty
to subdue opposition and prejudice, and to accomplish
the great purposes of grace.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The Crown and Sceptre.</span>&mdash;Upon entering this
house one evening, the Missionary found a new landlord
behind the bar. As he knew several of the
customers, he entered into serious conversation with
them, but was stopped by the landlord making the
declaration that "it was an abominable thing for a
man to talk religion in a public-house;" and then he
ordered the intruder to leave. As the man was angry,
the visitor went toward the door, merely remarking,
"We shall know each other some day, and shall no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
doubt improve upon acquaintance, as I wish to do you
a good turn,&mdash;the best thing one man can do for
another;" and then he left the house. He had not,
however, proceeded far down the street, when two
men ran after him, and said that the landlord wished
to speak to him. The visitor felt that mischief was
intended, but as an opportunity might be presented to
secure the good-will of the man, he boldly re-entered
the bar. To his surprise, the landlord, with a smile,
offered him a number of handbills, and said, "You
want to do me a good turn, do you? Well, this is how
you can manage it. I am told that you go into all the
houses about here, and I want you to put one of these
papers into each of your tracts, which will advertise
me among the right sort of people." The Missionary
read the bills aloud, and could but join in the laughter
produced, for they ran thus: "'Crown and Sceptre.'
The new landlord begs to inform the public that he
has taken this old-established house, and that he sells
the best porter at fourpence a quart, and good old
Tom at threepence-halfpenny a quartern," etc., etc.
The customers considered the request to circulate such
bills in religious tracts a good joke, but paused in their
merriment to hear the reply of the visitor, who stood
with the bills in his hand. That answer was given
in the unexpected form of a question addressed to a
group of costermongers who were standing at the other
side of the bar.</p>

<p>"Do you men over there know what a sceptre is?"</p>

<p>"Never heard nothin' of that 'ere sort of article," was
the reply, after some deliberation.</p>

<p>As the question evidently perplexed many of the
customers, the visitor smiled, and addressing the landlord,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
said, "If I can't circulate your bills for you, I will
make good use of them by acquainting your customers
with the full meaning of your sign. Well, you all know
that a crown is a kind of golden cap set with jewels and
set upon the head of kings. Now a sceptre is a golden
stick, about so long (showing the length with his hands),
and is a badge of kingly authority with which to govern
and to show mercy. I have seen the Queen's sceptre
in the Tower, and its top is richly ornamented and
studded with precious stones. In this Book (producing
the pocket Bible) there are beautiful things about
the sceptre, and if you like I will read you two short
passages. 'All the king's servants do know, that whosoever
shall come unto the King into the inner court,
who is not called, there is one law of his to put him to
death, except such to whom the King shall hold out the
golden sceptre, that he may live.' 'And the King held
out to Esther the golden sceptre which was in his hand.
So Esther drew near, and touched the top of the
sceptre.'" Then closing the Bible, he continued, "And
now, landlord, I have to tell you that the crown and
sceptre brought me here. After the Lord Jesus died to
save us, He rose from the grave and ascended into
heaven. He is there crowned King of kings, and He
has the sceptre of righteousness and mercy in His hand.
He holds out that golden stick to each of you sinful
men. By faith in Him you can touch it and be saved;"
and then placing several tracts upon the bar, he stepped
towards the door. He however turned back as an Irish
labourer, who was standing with several of his countrymen,
exclaimed,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Och, sure and it's the rail truth; and it's meself that
will do it, as I niver did that, and I'm intirely wretched."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span></p>

<p>This was uttered with deep feeling, and a gesture of
prayerful uplooking which showed that the comprehension
of the beautiful, that charm of the Irish character,
had caused the poor labourer to understand the lovely
truth of an enthroned and pardoning Redeemer. He
was invited to leave with the visitor, and they stood for
some time in the street conversing about the love of God
in Christ Jesus. The man stated that he was from
Tipperary, and a good Catholic, but that he had often
got drunk and had injured several persons. When ill,
by an accident he had met with in his work, he was an
inmate of Guy's Hospital for some weeks. When there,
a gentleman used to read out of the Bible to a man in
the next bed, and the man was very happy, though
he did not belong to the true faith, as he was always
speaking of Jesus, and never prayed to the saints. Since
then he had felt unhappy about his sins, though he often
went to mass and confession. The way of salvation
was simply explained to him, and his address was taken,
with the promise of a call. A few days after, his room
in a rookery called Grey's Buildings, was entered. His
wife, who expected the visitor, exclaimed, "In troth
and it's your honour; and wasn't it Mick that towld me
of your honour, and it's himself that has been praying
Jesus to howld out the golden stick to him." While
they were speaking Mick came in, and greeted his
friend with real Irish feeling; and then they sat before
the fire and conversed about the lovingkindness of
Him who is mighty to save. As the blessed result,
the poor Irishman was led to understand the way of
salvation, and by faith to touch the sceptre of Infinite
Mercy. Some months passed before he had courage
to enter a Protestant church, and then he was in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
company with his friend, whom he met by appointment.
He for some minutes lingered outside, and then entered
with a rush. After that his attendance was regular;
but he found it necessary to leave his lodgings, as his
conversion became known to the neighbours, and he
received several unpleasant visits from the priest. He
had two boys whom he sent to a Protestant school,
though opposed by his wife. His acquaintance was
kept up for several years, and he used to speak with
joy about the golden stick, and the knowledge it gave
him of the Saviour.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Elephant and Castle.</span>&mdash;Upon entering the
bar-parlour of this house the landlord commenced the
following conversation with the Missionary, concerning
the evidence he had given before a Committee of the
House of Commons: "I have, sir, been reading your
evidence in the Blue Book, and while I agree with much
that you said, I think that you were mistaken in two
particulars. First, when you said that there are more
persons in the public-houses of Marylebone upon the
evening of the Lord's-day, than there are in all the
churches and chapels of that parish. Secondly, your
advice for further restrictions upon our Sunday-sale,
coupled with your opinion, that a great number of our
houses could be entirely closed upon the Lord's-day
with benefit to the public and without loss to the
publican."</p>

<p>"I am not surprised at your view of my evidence,
but the sharp criticism of the trade has convinced me
that I spoke the truth temperately. As regards the
appalling statement as to the number of persons who
frequent your houses upon the Lord's-day evening, you
must have observed that I was sharply examined upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
the point, and confirmed it with much detail; when I
had finished, the chief Inspector of Police and other
important persons were examined upon the matter, and
confirmed my statement; after which the Committee
reported it to Parliament as unquestionably true. It is
then a terrible fact, certainly true, of all the poor neighbourhoods
of London. As regards the closing on
Sundays, and its effect upon the trade, I merely gave
an opinion; but that opinion was arrived at after
conversation with several hundred members of your
trade. As you know, forty-seven publicans in this
parish signed a petition, praying Parliament to close
you upon the whole of Sunday. Few men have a
larger acquaintance with the trade than myself, and
I am convinced that a strong feeling against Sabbath
labour, and other evils of this business, is growing up
among you. For instance, several of your neighbours
now close their houses upon the whole of the Lord's-day,
others close their tap-rooms, and many refrain
from lighting the glaring lamps outside. This shows
a desire to use the great moral power you possess for
the good of the people. And then as regards the loss
resulting from Sunday closing, I am convinced that
the saying of the Book is true: 'That in keeping His
commandments there is great reward.' I am, however,
content to reason the point with you from a trade
point of view. It is a fact that all who close bear the
loss lightly, if loss there be. One house at Shoreditch
has been established more than a hundred years, though,
for all that time, the following 'rules' have been
printed over the bar:&mdash;</p>

<p>
"'1. No person served a second time.<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>"'2. No person served if in the least intoxicated.<br />
"'3. No swearing or improper language allowed.<br />
"'4. Smoking not permitted.<br />
"'5. When you enter a place of business, transact your business,<br />
and go about your business.<br />
</p>
<p>
"'<span class="smcap">Closed on Sunday.</span>'"<br /></p>


<p>"The landlord told me that after the experience of a
century they had no wish to alter the rules. Twenty-six
other Sunday-closing publicans, with whom I conversed,
told me that the loss is really small. They lend
bottles of various sizes to their customers upon the
payment of a small deposit, which increases the Saturday's
returns; and as they save one-seventh of wear
and tear and gas, the cost of obtaining a Sabbath of
rest is to many small indeed. But be this as it may,
the old question remains, put by Him who alone knew
the value of the world He made and of the soul He
created,&mdash;for all souls are His: 'What will it profit a
man, if he gain the whole world, and lose his own soul?'
You, and many of my friends in the trade, give a
practical answer to this question by suppressing drunkenness,
though much to your money loss (for I never saw
a person the worse for liquor in your house); extend
that answer by observing the Sabbath-day to keep it
holy."</p>

<p>A few weeks after this conversation the Missionary
entered the house again, in company with a clergyman
from the Isle of Wight. The landlord asked them into
the bar-parlour, and called his wife. He then produced
a board, and said, "Since our last conversation, sir, I
have considered the cost, and have had this board
printed, and intend to put it outside next Monday
morning. It will no doubt increase my trade difficulties,
but with God's help I shall hope still to get on."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
The writing upon the board was: "<span class="smcap">Notice.</span> On and
after Sunday next, this house will be closed during
the whole of the Lord's-day." They were commended
for the good resolution, and the clergyman, at parting,
observed, "You said wisely, that you hoped with God's
help to succeed: that help can only be obtained in
answer to prayer. Would it not therefore be well for
us to seek the required blessing?" Upon this the landlady
rose and locked the door, and while the barmaid
was supplying the customers, her employers were kneeling
with the Missionary, while the clergyman engaged
in prayer.</p>

<p>The board was placed outside the house, and caused
quite a sensation in the neighbourhood, and much jesting
in the bar. The resolution was, however, kept; and
after a year's Sunday closing, the landlord expressed
his determination to continue in the right way, as he
had found it possible to conduct the business upon
Christian principles.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Mogul.</span>&mdash;A dirty little beer-shop, entirely
supported by low and depraved persons. The taproom
was built in the yard beside a skittle ground, and was
approached through a long passage. Upon entering it
one evening the Missionary found a crowd of at least
forty juvenile thieves, vagrants, and bullies. As the
noise was great, the only hope of doing good was an
effort to enter into conversation with one or two individuals.
This, however, was prevented, as many of
them knew the visitor, and hit upon a device to get rid
of him. A song was started by one of the men, and
the chorus was taken up by the full company, who
repeated with deafening effect the words, "He's a jolly
good fellow." As the song proceeded the repetition<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
became so boisterous that the visitor divined their
intention to sing him out. He at once saw the difficulty
of his position, as, if they had succeeded, the
same practice would have been adopted in other taprooms
to the hindrance of his usefulness. He, therefore,
instead of leaving, took a seat in their midst in
a most unconcerned manner. The chorus was kept up
until many of the vocalists had bawled themselves
hoarse; and as the yelling became feeble the visitor
sprang to his feet, and said vehemently, "And they
were good fellows, but the magistrates commanded to
beat them. And when they had laid many stripes
upon them, they cast them into prison, charging the
jailer to keep them safely; who, having received such
a charge, thrust them into the inner prison, and made
their feet fast in the stocks."</p>

<p>The words changed the current of feeling. Nearly
all in the room had been in prison, and those who
had not had a deep sympathy with such. "Who was
they?" "Where was it?" and "What a shame!" were
the general exclamations.</p>

<p>After a pause, which produced absolute silence, the
speaker continued: "And at midnight they sang
praises unto God." And then opening his Bible, he
in a solemn, earnest tone, read the narrative of the
imprisonment of Paul and Silas. When he came to
the words, "He set meat before them and rejoiced,
believing in God, with all his house," the reader closed
the Book, and in a few telling sentences explained the
nature of saving faith in Christ, and the result of that
faith,&mdash;being made "new creatures." After this visit
the work was easy in that taproom, and in the family
of the landlord.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">The King's Head.</span>&mdash;One afternoon, while the visitor
was speaking with several respectable men in this bar, the
barman addressed him with the exclamation, "Blessed
are your lips." He was so surprised at the words that
he approached the young man, and inquired what he
meant. "Well, sir," he replied, "I hear cursing and
swearing all day long, up till twelve o'clock at night,
and you are the only man who speaks really good
words. Why, we have some tradesmen come in here
for lunch who are known religious men, and they talk
politics and all sorts of things, but they haven't a
word to say about religion. It's as if they were
ashamed to acknowledge God when they get in here:
now, you condemn sinning and swearing, and I, therefore,
made the remark 'Blessed are your lips.'"</p>

<p>"I am glad you are at leisure," was the reply, "as
you have started a subject upon which I want the
help of the trade, both master and man. This habit
of profane swearing among the people is a crying evil,
and you are the victims of its pollution more than any
other class of tradesmen, which need not and ought not
to be the case. In this part of London the habit is
too general; but the abomination is still worse at the
East end. I have with me a copy of the <i>Church and
State Review</i>, in which a gentleman gives an account
of his visits the other night with a detective. He
writes: 'We stopped before one house in which all
the crusts that are begged in the streets are turned
into gin. Everybody blasphemed at intervals, except
the women, who never stopped at all. There were
old men and old women&mdash;everything that is made
after the image of God, down to the little child&mdash;and
the foulness of all was equal. It was fearful to hear<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
the words that rolled from the lips of the crone, who
was full of years and spirits; but it was agony to hear
the curses stream from the baby-mouths, when midnight
had passed and it was far away in the morning.'
Now, we have a Missionary who visits the houses there,
and he was deeply grieved at the pollutions that met
his ears; so he had a card about a foot square printed,
and illuminated with a double blue border containing
four mottoes between: 'Be sober;' 'Swear not at all;'
'Be sure your sin will find you out;' 'Thou God seest
me.' The requisition in the centre is printed in scarlet
characters, forming a pretty contrast to the border, and
is as follows: 'It is respectfully requested that persons
attending this house will refrain from using improper
language.' He took them round to the landlords, and
to their credit, nearly four hundred placed them in their
bars and taps; and many joined heartily in the effort
to suppress the evil. Though scarcely a year has
passed, the result is most satisfactory; and I should
like to introduce the cards into this part of London:
the trade and myself can work together in this matter
and I trust that your master will allow one to be placed
in this bar."</p>

<p>"I am sure that he will," was the reply; "and I
will ask him, and all the barmen I know, to assist in
the good effort."</p>

<p>A card was placed in that bar, and many of the
neighbouring bars, taps, and parlours, were ornamented
with them; and as "the rules of the house," an effective
check was given to guilty tongues. Another good
of great importance sprang from the conversation with
the barman. The peculiar temptations of the class
were considered, and a special effort was made for their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">&nbsp;</a></span>
spiritual good. A pocket Testament was given to three
hundred of them, with suitable remarks as to the value
of the good Book, and the duty of daily reading it.
The attention of many publicans was for the time
directed to the Book, and many purchased larger
copies. A distribution was then commenced among
those publicans and coffee-house keepers who let lodgings,
and hundreds of Bibles were placed in their sleeping
rooms; the movement extended to the hotels
(the Books having their signs in gilt letters upon the
covers), and terminated by an arrangement with the
managers of the Great Western Hotel, by which nearly
a hundred copies of the Scriptures were placed in
their bedrooms.</p>

</div>

<p>The barmaids were really thankful for the Bible and
Card movement, as their suffering from blasphemous
and bad language was great. The following incident
will illustrate this: The visitor was one afternoon
standing in a gin palace, quietly conversing with the
two barmaids, when three well-dressed young men of
"turfy" style entered, and called for "brandies and
soda." They conversed merrily about an incident
which had occurred to one of them, using corrupt
words with every sentence. A deep blush rose to the
face of the younger barmaid, who had not been long
in the business. The visitor turned towards the man,
and said sharply, "Dear me, what can be the matter
with you?"</p>

<p>"I am all right," he replied, inquiringly.</p>

<p>"You are not all right," was the reply: "but I can tell
what's the matter with you. When a man is ill the
doctor examines his tongue, and if it is furred he knows
that it indicates foulness within, and that the patient<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
requires treatment; and it's just so when men with
their tongues defile themselves and others. It shows a
diseased moral state when the poison of asps is under a
man's tongue."</p>

<p>The severe rebuke so astonished the man that he
could not give a ready reply; but one of his companions
said, "We meant no harm, sir."</p>

<p>As the barmaids had fled to the other end of the
counter, the visitor altered his tone to one of kindly
instruction, and said, "You don't know your disease,
and I shall, therefore, do you a kindness by pointing it
out to you." He then opened his Bible and read, "The
tongue is a fire, a world of iniquity: so is the tongue
among our members, that it defileth the whole body,
and setteth on fire the whole course of nature; and it is
set on fire of hell." He then referred to the passage,
"Children that are corrupters," and told them that this
evil, with all others, proceeded out of the corrupt human
heart; and of that blood which cleanseth from all sin,
and makes a man every whit whole. The men, who
showed a very proper spirit, promised to suppress the
hateful habit, and shook hands with their reprover.</p>

<p>Upon his next visit the barmaids thanked him; and
the youngest said, "I have been religiously brought up;
and my grandfather, who was an Independent Minister,
pressed me to give my heart to God when I was a little
girl. You have brought all to my remembrance, and
I shall leave this trade for domestic service, as I have
resolved to live in newness of life."</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p><span class="smcap">The Merlin's Cave.</span>&mdash;There was a special inducement
to visit this house out of its regular order, as
placards announced that "The gorilla, or man-monkey,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
had not made its escape, but could be seen by customers
using the bar." Upon entering, one Sunday evening,
the Missionary was surprised to find the place crowded
with the lowest order of drunkards, chiefly from Seven
Dials. Their object was to see the stuffed skin of the
monster, and they, for so respectable a house, formed
a ragged, dirty, and debased company. The landlord,
who was unfavourable to Christian visitation, stopped
a conversation of deep interest by inviting the visitor to
look at the gorilla. "We don't usually show it on
Sundays," he observed, "but as you have come in we
will oblige you and gratify the people." And he then
drew the curtain aside. All pressed forward to look at
the monster; and the Missionary, leaning upon the bar,
gazed at it for some moments.</p>

<p>"How he is staring at it!" observed one of the men.</p>

<p>"Yes, I am," was the reply, "as I was making up a
conundrum for the landlord; and I hope he will answer
it to our general satisfaction. 'When is a man uglier
than that gorilla?'"</p>

<p>After a little thought, he replied, "A man never can
be uglier than that, so I will give it up."</p>

<p>"Yes, he can," replied the visitor, with energy: "When
he is drunk. Yes: a drunkard is the picture of a beast,
and the monster of a man. Dressed in rags, with livid
face and blood-shot eyes, and filthy breath, he sinks
below a brute like that, which answered the end of its
being. A drunkard debases his intellect and becomes a
mere animal&mdash;a wife-beater and child-starver&mdash;a pest to
his neighbours, and a disgrace to his family and country.
A drunkard has the curse of the Almighty over him
which no brute has; for being filthy and abominable&mdash;a
child of the devil&mdash;He, the great God, has said that such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
shall not inherit His kingdom." The landlord stood
aghast at the warmth of this declamatory speech; and
the drunkards seemed rooted to the spot. Tracts were
then handed round, a passage of Scripture being repeated
with each.</p>

<p>Quite a group of conscience-stricken men and women
had stopped outside, and were waiting for the visitor.
One of them, a woman, seemed to express the general
state of feeling, when she said, "Can't do without it now,
master. Can do without food; but though the drink is
killing me, I should die without it." And then she
cried, as drunkards are so ready to do. The state of
disease which alcohol had produced in her was explained,
and she was told that a little medical attention,
total abstinence from intoxicating drinks, and regular
diet, would save her from the drunkard's grave, and
would put her in the right position to seek pardon and
deliverance from the eternal curse. She readily gave
her address, and the visitor promised to call next day to
receive her pledge, and to give her further advice.</p>

<p>That visit was not lost, as the woman, who kept a
beer-shop in the "Dials," was recovered from her debased
condition, and with her husband became morally
reformed.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p><span class="smcap">The White Horse.</span>&mdash;The potman at this house was
a young man of unusual sobriety and intelligence. In
style and work he was to perfection the "man of the
tap," as his short apron was always clean, his room comfortable,
and his pots shining. The men were often
unruly and quarrelsome, but he always kept order, and
got over the pressure for trust with such tact that his
master never lost a customer. A grave shaking of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
head, and a pointing at a picture on the wall, which
represented a dog named "Trust" lying dead between
two barrels, usually settled the matter. If not he read
the inscription, "Poor Trust is dead: bad pay killed
him;" and in a melancholy way expressed his regret
that "he could not help that dog a-dying, or he would."
Like many of his class, he felt proud of his position,
as in the tap he took rank equal to his master in the
parlour. Frequenters of the room acknowledged this,
and, as the representative of the firm, appealed to him
on knotty questions. Such a question arose one evening
when a man, who had the habit of fixing attention upon
some matter contained in a Book he carried, told them
about the Saviour of the world ascending to heaven in a
white cloud, and added, the angels said, "This same
Jesus, which is taken up from you into heaven, shall
so come in like manner as ye have seen Him go into
heaven;" and then he made the solemn announcement,
"Behold, He cometh with clouds, and every eye shall
see Him." The men who knew little of Christianity
were utterly ignorant of this great truth, and its enunciation
produced thoughtfulness, and a conversation the
very reverse of that which usually took place in the
room. One man appealed to "Potts," as he was called,
as to whether that was in all the Bibles; as if it was,
it might come true. Potts very wisely looked at the
visitor, and said, "He's very likely to know, and if he'll
tell me where it is, I will look in a Bible this very night
and see if it's there." He was commended for his
answer, and told of the men of Berea, "who were more
noble than those in Thessalonica, in that they received
the Word with all readiness of mind, and searched the
Scriptures daily, whether those things were so." The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
men were then, in a short but earnest address, directed
to the coming Judge as the present Saviour.</p>

<p>A few months after this visit, the Missionary one
afternoon entered the tap-room, as he desired to hold
private converse with Potts. That worthy was by himself,
and was, with great effort, writing a letter.</p>

<p>"It's strange that you should have come in, sir," he
observed, "as I am a writing a letter to my sister, for
whom I cares a great deal, as there is only us two; and
we has bin orphans since we was very little, and she is
a parlour-maid at Maidstone; and I don't mind you
reading the letter, sir, as it's all true that's in it."</p>

<p>His friend with some difficulty got through the
epistle, as its writing and orthography were very bad.
It commenced in the famous "hoping to find you quite
well as it leaves me at present" style; and then, as we
put it in readable language, he said, "I have, my dear
sister, made up my mind to be a Christian. A gentleman
who comes in here has made the duty of being
religious very plain, and I have got a view of Jesus like
this:&mdash;if you were woke up in the dark night by a
fire-escape man in your room, you would not at first
understand what it meant; but as soon as you got a
good look at him, you would see by his clothes and
helmet what he was, and you would let him save you.
Now that is just how I see Jesus Christ; everything
about Him shows that He is the Saviour, and I am
letting Him save me. As I cannot now be comfortable
here, I have obtained work at a fishmonger's, and I
want you to come to London. I will try and get you
a good place, and then you will not be subjected to the
temptations of the trade." He was strengthened and
encouraged in the good resolution which he carried out,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
and some time after he gave his friend valuable assistance
in the formation of a local society for the abolition
of Sunday labour.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p><span class="smcap">The Coach and Horses.</span>&mdash;Two visits of considerable
interest took place in this house, though at long
intervals.</p>

<p>As the Missionary entered the bar one evening, the
landlord said, in a half whisper, "The fight for the
championship comes off in the morning, and a lot of
the P. R.'s are in the club room."</p>

<p>"Can you pass me up?"</p>

<p>"It's no use your going there," was the reply; "but I
will, if you like:" and then the visitor passed upstairs
and entered the room. About thirty men were present,
the majority being unmistakable members of the prize-ring.
As every eye was fixed upon the new arrival, he
felt embarrassed as to his mode of procedure; indeed,
there was no help but to produce his tracts and to commence
distribution. He had given about a dozen, when
the men rolled them up as balls and commenced pelting
each other across the room, uttering vile words. The
distributor at once saw that his work was likely to be
brought into contempt, and that evil instead of good
might result from the visit. He therefore, as many
were pressing him for tracts, put them into his pocket.
During the few minutes he had been there, he had
noticed an elderly man of damaged face and whiskerless
who was seated at a table with two gentlemen. He was
drinking from a large silver prize-cup, which indicated
that he was an ex-champion. His hand was resting
upon the table, and a diamond of great beauty glittered
upon his finger&mdash;as the lapidists say, it "gave fire."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
The distributor looked at it, and approaching its owner,
remarked, in so loud a tone that all in the room heard
him, "What a lovely ring! I have not seen so fine a
brilliant as this for some time: it must certainly be
worth a hundred pounds."</p>

<p>"That's it," replied the ex-champion. "They say
that it's worth a hundred guineas. A gent that's dead
and gone bet two thousand upon me when I beat the
Slasher; and in the morning he came to 'cossit' me, as
he said, and brought me this."</p>

<p>"It's the jewel that's worth the money," said the
visitor. "Why, the gold of the ring would not fetch
three pounds." All assented to this. And he continued.
"Well, it's just so with these tracts you have
been throwing about: as bits of paper they cost little or
nothing, and are not worth your acceptance; but they
are all studded with a jewel&mdash;the pearl of great price:"
and then raising his voice to a clear ringing pitch, he
exclaimed, "The name of the Lord Jesus, by whom
alone each man in this room can be saved, is upon
them,&mdash;He is the gem. None other name is given by
which you can obtain mercy." And then placing some
tracts upon the table, he left the room with a firm tread.
The men were so interested and surprised that scarcely
a word was spoken. A few days after, the potman told
the distributor that the pugilists did not destroy a tract
or leave one behind.</p>

<p>More than two years after this event the Missionary
was standing one morning at the bar, in conversation
with the landlady, when he noticed, the parlour door
being open, a very aged man seated with a glass of
sherry before him. His beard, which was very long, and
his few remaining hairs were as white as the driven<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
snow: and as he leaned upon his gold-headed cane he
looked beautiful,&mdash;he had indeed that rich beauty of age
which in its day is more lovely than the bloom of youth.
The visitor approached politely, and asked his acceptance
of a little book. He received it with a smile, and
entered freely into conversation, which ended in the
following way: "And now, sir, may I put the question
to you which one of the Pharaohs put to an aged man
who was led up to the throne by his son?"</p>

<p>"Certainly."</p>

<p>"'How old art thou?'"</p>

<p>"Just turned eighty-four."</p>

<p>"An honourable age. But your answer is not so full
as that which good old Jacob gave. He told the King
that 'the days of the years of his pilgrimage were an
hundred and thirty years;' and added, 'Few and evil
have the days of the years of my life been, and have not
attained unto the days of the years of the life of my
fathers in the days of their pilgrimage.' He spoke of
life as short, for upon looking back time appeared to
have passed quickly; he spoke of his days as 'evil,' for
he had had his share of care and sorrows: but, best of
all, he confessed to the heathen King that he was but a
stranger and pilgrim upon the earth, and so acknowledged
his belief in, and his hope of, enduring rest in the
better country. I trust that you have like precious faith,
and the assurance that you are near the prepared mansions,&mdash;the
city of habitation whose Builder and Maker
is God?"</p>

<p>"No: I am not;" and as he said it his voice trembled
and the tears started into his eyes. "I am not a Christian,
and am most miserable. I was a merchant, and
until fifty years of age was absorbed in the one object<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
of making money. I then retired upon an ample fortune,
and for the next twenty years I loved and enjoyed
the world, and collected art-work and things of beauty,
with which my houses are filled. During that time I
never thought seriously of eternal things, and scarcely
ever read my Bible. Of late years I have ceased to take
pleasure in these things, and I am truly wretched. My
son, who is a diplomatist, when in England, brought
several divines to see me, but I cannot get peace. This
morning I came out for a walk, and feeling fatigued I
looked in here, and as no one was in the room I called
for light refreshment&mdash;and am taking rest. It seems
strange that such a man as you should accost me here,&mdash;and
it may be of God. Let us exchange cards, and
come and dine with me."</p>

<p>Cards were exchanged, and next day the "parlour
friends" dined together. Some time was spent in looking
over the beautiful and curious possessions of the old
gentleman, and then they settled down to deep spiritual
conference. Many a page of the pocket Bible was
turned over, and the verities of the Word were made
manifest. The library door was then fastened, and deep
earnest prayer was offered to the God of all grace.</p>

<p>Many visits followed, and the friendship was cemented.
One day, as the visitor entered the dining-room, the old
gentleman grasped his hand, and said, "The cloud is
removed: I feel as a little child, and am resting with
comfort upon God's love in Jesus;" and then he uttered
the language of rejoicing. For five or six months he
was happy, and his family were made glad. One morning
his friend received a deep black-bordered letter from
his eldest daughter, who was staying with him at his
country house, and it read thus: "As my late father's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
dearest friend, I write to tell you of his sudden removal.
He had been poorly for several days, and was taken
really ill yesterday morning. We had three physicians,
but they could only give him a little ease, as he was
evidently dying. He was conscious to the last, and very
happy. He fell asleep at two o'clock this morning, with
the name of Jesus upon his lips. Our gratitude to you
for your deep interest in him, and kind attention, is deep,
and will remain for life."</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>The Lord sent forth the seventy "two and two before
His face into every city and place." In effective lay-work
the principle holds good through all the difficulties
of domiciliary effort. The Missionaries of London and
other large towns have each a responsible helper,&mdash;their
local superintendent. It thus occurred that the man
with the Book never stood alone in his work, and if
he had it would have been feebly done. His beloved
superintendent bore his full share of responsibility.
At first he visited with him that he might make himself
fully acquainted with the nature of the work and then
he gave prayerful influence, with Christian council and
sustaining sympathy. Under God, much of the success
which attended, and still attends the visitation of
public and coffee-houses, is due to the direction of that
"honourable counsellor," Mr. W. R. Ellis.</p>

<p>And here it is well to add that the chief secretaries
of the Mission, the Rev. John Garwood and the late
Rev. John Robinson, have left an impress of good upon
this and each branch of the work. Their clearness of
judgment and full comprehension of the will of the
committee, always gave value to their advice; while
their devotion to the cause of Christ in London stimulated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
the zeal, and gave solidity to the labours of young
missionaries. This testimony can now be given, as one
of them has received the upward call from the Master;
and the other, after forty years of faithful service, has
retired from official responsibility, though still active as
a director of the Society's affairs. Blessed, indeed, are
they who are called in early life to labour in the Gospel,
and are honoured with long life in the highest and best
employ, with sure anticipation of the blessed rest!</p>

<p class="cap_1">LONDON never sleeps. The noise and din
of the mighty city is hushed as the night
advances and the toiling millions of the day
sink to repose; but their rest is the signal
for the activity of others. The protection of
its vast accumulation of wealth and property
requires an army of police. The supply of its
markets requires the wakefulness of thousands, while its
traffic requires an extensive night service of cabmen and
others. In addition to these, and workers upon the
morning press, and other sons of toil who earn their
daily bread by night, there is the vast multitude of those
who</p>
</div>

<div class="poem">

<span class="i0">
"Live to sin, and sin to live,"</span>
</div>

<p>and who, as the evenings close in, leave their homes and
dens to seek the wages of unrighteousness. These two
orders of the industrious and depraved would make up
a city as large as Birmingham, and they require that
many night-houses and coffee-stalls should be established
to meet their necessities. And so the children of the
night are increased, and we therefore repeat the statement,
that "London never sleeps."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span></p>

<p>This conviction was forced upon the attention of the
Missionary to public- and coffee-houses, when he found
that many of the latter were closed all day, and was informed
that they were only opened at night. As it was
his duty to make the proprietors and supporters of these
houses acquainted with the glad tidings of peace, he had
no choice but to visit them in the night season. Upon
making the effort, he discovered that while the wicked
never ceased from their wickedness, but during the hours
of darkness gave unbounded license to their evil deeds,
the people whom the Lord has set as His watchmen in
the city slumbered and slept. A vast multitude existed
who, of a truth, loved darkness rather than light because
their deeds were evil; but no ray from the Sun of Righteousness
was made to penetrate the darkness of the
shadow of death in which they dwelt. They lay deeply
poisoned by the fangs of the serpent sin, but no balm of
Gilead or leaf from the tree of life was offered to them.
Captives of the devil, they were bound and fettered by
the cords of their iniquities, being in ignorance of that
mighty Deliverer who was manifested to destroy the
works of the devil, and to set at liberty them that are
bound.</p>

<p>The sinners were astonished when, in the silence of
the night-watches, a voice was heard in the streets proclaiming,
in loving accents, the tender mercies of a great
<i>Redeemer</i>. Many an honest worker or driver was arrested
or comforted by sayings which reached his ears
from the Book of Life, or was benefited by the silent
messenger of mercy placed into his hands. Many a
sin-wrecked one who had been brought to feel that there
was no hand to deliver him, and who in blank despair
was ready to seek a prison or a watery grave, heard the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
sweet notes of salvation, and was delivered from going
down into the pit. There were many, however, of reprobate
mind who, being filled with all unrighteousness,
resisted the King's messenger, and bitterly opposed
themselves to the truth. This was the case at a place
called by the outcasts "Teddie's Den;" and by way of
illustrating the power of the Book we will narrate the
religious history of that house, strange as it may sound.</p>

<p>It was an old-established concern, and had a connection
of its own. This was evident, as the customers
were so well known to the landlord that their step, or
tap, or knock, was sufficient to secure their ready admission.
It was not so with the Missionary. When he
knocked and asked for an entrance, the only reply he
received was in a gruff tone, and to the effect, that they
were "shutting up." In order to gain an entry he then
obtained the promise of a pass in from a young thief of
his acquaintance. This, however, was unnecessary, as,
upon passing the door a little before two o'clock one
Sunday morning he noticed that it was partly open, no
doubt for purposes of ventilation. This was a rare opportunity,
which he embraced by immediately stepping
in. He called for a cup of coffee, and while it was being
brought took notice of the place and people. The den
consisted of an ordinary shop and parlour; the former
was fitted up with narrow tables, at which were seated
about twenty men and women; many of these were
leaning forward upon their hands, apparently asleep.
A few were of the vagrant and beggar class, who, perhaps,
had only sufficient money to purchase a little food,
and the right to remain there for a few hours; but the
majority were evidently of the vicious and criminal order.
The room was extremely dirty, and the dim light from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
the old oil lamps seemed to increase its gloom: the
spangled sky, however, could be seen through the upper
squares of glass, as the row of shutters only reached to
the top panes. The back room, or "parlour," had a
cheerful fire, was better lighted, and was no doubt filled
with paying customers. There was laughter and merriment,
but the oaths and blasphemies which reached the
ear were truly terrible. It was evident that these men
and women of the baser sort were holding a swearing
club,&mdash;an amusement so hellish that we forbear a description.
There was not time for further observation, as
the landlord, a big, brutal-looking man, approached with
the coffee.</p>

<p>An illustrated publication was offered to him, with the
remark, "You don't, I see, supply papers to your
customers; so I will occasionally give you some of
these."</p>

<p>He took the paper with a deep frown, threw it upon
the floor, and with a bitter oath, said, "I know you:
you spy,&mdash;you canting wretch!" and, turning round, he
locked the door; and then approaching the Missionary
with the key grasped in his hand and trembling with
rage, threatened vengeance. At this display of anger
the customers rose from their seats and pressed forward,
while the dreadful people poured in from the back room.
It was an awful moment for the visitor, as he sat there
helpless in the midst of that crowd of the violent and
the guilty. Realizing the danger of his position, he
uttered an inward prayer for help, and then, springing
up, he struck his hand with violence upon the table,
and pointing over the shutters to the clouds, exclaimed
in a loud voice, "<span class="smcap">A great white throne will be
set up among the stars there</span>. The Saviour who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">&nbsp;</a></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">&nbsp;</a></span>
died for sinners will sit upon it, for the dead that are in
their graves shall hear His voice and live. We shall be
there."</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 331px;">
<img src="images/i219.jpg" width="331" height="500" alt="&quot;A great white throne will be set up among the stars, there!&quot;" title="Facing the angry landlord and a gang of customers" />
<span class="caption">&quot;A great white throne will be set up among the stars, there!&quot;</span>
</div>

<p>At this every tongue became silent, and the people
stood back, gazing upwards or into his face. Therefore,
pointing at one and another, he continued, "And
you, and you; for we must all stand before the judgment-seat
of Christ. I am not an enemy or a spy, but a servant
of the Lord Jesus, who will judge you at the last
day. He is now the Saviour of the ruined and the lost,
and in His name I offer you mercy through the blood
He shed for you upon the cross. In this His blessed
Book it is written, 'Whosoever believeth on Him shall
be saved.'" The speaker then stepped toward the door,
which the landlord unlocked with a trembling hand, and
he passed out into the cold, silent street.</p>

<p>There is a charm in the solitude of a sleeping city.
The hum of the multitude and the deafening rattle upon
the stones are stayed, while the distinct tread of the
pedestrian and more measured tread of the policeman,
seem the only link between the slumbering myriads and
the activities of the day. As the distant footsteps fall
upon the ear there is an instinctive turning towards the
approaching or receding objects. The visitor had not
proceeded far from the den when he heard footsteps,
and upon turning round saw the landlord coming toward
him; he therefore stopped under the next lamp,
and awaited his arrival. With faltering voice he said,
"Come again, guv'nor. Didn't mean anything; and a
chap as knows you says as it's all right."</p>

<p>The words, "Come again," were as music to the man
with the Book; for he felt that the door of that dreadful
place was opened, and that he had obtained power,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
under the protection of that bad man, there to read from
its pages of judgment and mercy, and in the Name of
names to rescue ruined ones from present and eternal
destruction. He therefore replied, "Never mind the
past; it is all right with me. I do all the good I can
for people, and don't injure anybody. I will now call
as a friend of yours. When shall it be?"</p>

<p>"You sees, guv'nor," he replied, "as we lives different
to other people, cos our okupation is at night; and we
opens at twelve and shuts up at six in the morning, when
we has our supper at seven and goes to bed, and then
we gits up to breakfast at five, as would be your tea-time;
and if you'll turn in this afternoon, as is Sunday,
we'll have winkles and muffins, and you'll see as I ain't
a bully as some is, though my temper ain't zackly right
allus."</p>

<p>The promise was given, and punctually at five o'clock
that afternoon the invited guest entered the den. It
had been swept, but the floor, tables, and wall were of
the same sombre colour, while the air was offensive.
The back room, into which he was welcomed by his new
friend, was in the same condition, but better furnished,
for there was an old couch and several chairs; the walls
being decorated with a Dutch clock and pieces of old
tinware, while upon the grate, which had never been
cleaned, was a large boiler and two kettles. The house
was so closely built in, that it was only a dusky light
which penetrated its small side windows; that light was,
however, sufficient to show that the landlord's family
and four of the depraved persons who had been impressed
at the visit of the early morning were present.</p>

<p>It was evident that the family consisted of the landlord,
his wife, and a daughter about twelve years old.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
The "missus," as she with pleasant familiarity was
called, was a low coarse woman of forty-five, strangely
but expensively attired. Her dress was of brown silk,
trimmed with lace, in front of which she wore a braided
white apron with large pockets, not unlike a toll-collector's.
Her cap was smartly trimmed with red
ribbon; and upon her bare neck was a thick coral necklace
of many rows, and a heavy gold-like chain; her
dirt begrimed fingers being ornamented with at least
eight rings. The little girl was dressed in like fashion.</p>

<p>Both tea and coffee were ready in soot-covered vessels
upon the hob. At one end of the dirty table was a tray,
upon which were cracked cups and saucers of questionable
cleanliness; and on the table itself was a little
pyramid of periwinkles; while upon a heap of ashes before
the fire were two plates, heavily piled with muffins
and crumpets. These observations were quickly taken,
and the visitor became thoughtful concerning the feast
before him. When the tea was poured out he looked
with anxiety at the cups, wondering which would be
inflicted upon him; but when the muffins were placed
upon the table, and a generous supply of periwinkles
were pushed towards him&mdash;the women plucking pins
from their dresses&mdash;he was seized with a sudden loss of
appetite. The hospitable host and hostess increased his
misery by showing determination that he should enjoy
their good things. Such horrors as that tea must not
however be dwelt upon. Let it suffice, that time which
remedies so much, slow as it seemed to pass upon that
memorable occasion, did at last bring the repast to an
end.</p>

<p>During the tea the little party were set at ease and
led into pleasant conversation; and when the things<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
were cleared away, the visitor laid his pocket-Bible upon
the table with the remark, "This is Sunday, the happy
day, as my little boy calls it; and we all ought to be
happy upon this day, as we are reminded of God's
goodness and the Saviour's mercy; after dying for our
sins, He, upon the Sunday morning, rose from the dead.
Now, as none of you attend divine worship, suppose I
read to you about Him and the words He spoke?"</p>

<p>There was general assent, and the visitor read that
marvellous chapter commencing with the words, "Then
drew near unto Him all the publicans and sinners for to
hear Him. And the Pharisees and scribes murmured,
saying, 'This man receiveth sinners and eateth with
them.'" The little party listened with rapt attention,
and several were moved to tears by the running commentary
which was made upon the parables. The landlord
and his wife, in their strange way, assured the
reader that he was welcome to come when he pleased;
and they parted as pleasantly as though they had been
old friends. Weary, but happy, the Missionary entered
the first church he came to with the object of giving
thanks to the Lord in His Temple, for deliverance from
danger, and for mission mercies received; and he then
presented prayer for spiritual success with the keepers of
that night-house and their supporters.</p>

<p>About a week after the tea he paid a midnight visit
to the den, and as he entered the landlord commanded
silence in the following words: "I know this 'ere gent,
and if you doesn't shut up while he's here, I'll have you
out with a shake and a kick. You bad manner'd brutes,
to keep your hats on when your betters comes in." This
was sufficient to secure silence, while tracts were delivered
with scriptural remarks. It was thought well<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
that the visits should be short until influence was
obtained with the customers. The Missionary therefore
left, after fixing attention upon the word <i>Saviour</i>
and its sweet meaning. He then pinned his address
card upon the wall, and said, "Let this remain here. I
have told you how to obtain pardon from Almighty
God; but as it may be difficult for some of you to leave
lives of sin, I shall be glad to be the friend of any who
are truly penitent. Some of you might be glad of some
one to plead with your relations, and I might assist
others into institutions of mercy."</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/i225.jpg" width="500" height="415" alt="See p. 206." title="Poor outcast children"/>
<span class="caption">See p. 206.</span>
</div>

<p>In answer to this invitation several outcasts called
during the week upon the "reformatory man," as they
pleased to style him, and were rescued. Early one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
morning, the keeper of the night-house came himself,
leading by the hand a little girl without shoes or
stockings. She was offensively dirty, with dishevelled
hair, her frock of rags being pinned round her. He
fairly dragged her in at the door, and said, "This 'ere
gal, sir, has been about the streets for months, as she's a
Irish cockney, as we calls 'em. Her mother is dead,
and her father has bolted; and she sleeps under stairs
where the doors are open, and under the arches with them
that's got no homes; and she gits into my shop for bits
of grub; and a woman, who is a bad lot, wants to take
her, and we had a row, and I have bringed her to you,&mdash;and
here she is."</p>

<p>Yes; there the poor child stood, an object to be
shuddered at and avoided; but a fit object for Christian
compassion. To provide for her was a difficulty, as the
Missionary had burdened so many Institutions with
cases that he scarcely knew where to apply. After conferring
with his wife, it was arranged that she should be
cleaned in the back kitchen, and dressed in one of their
children's old clothes, while he went in search of a home
for her. After hours of toil, all the success he met with
was a promise from the manager of a crowded home to
receive her at the end of three days, when an inmate
was to leave. There was, therefore, no help but to keep
the child for that time.</p>

<p>A bed was made up for her in the kitchen, and orders
given that the doors should be all locked, and that she
should be carefully watched. There appeared little need
for this, as the child was shy and reserved; but she
proved to be deeply cunning. Next morning, while
the family were at breakfast, she slipped upstairs with
a key which had been left upon the dresser, and entering<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
a room, she stole two dresses&mdash;one of them a good
silk,&mdash;and fifteen shillings in money. The theft was soon
discovered, but the thief had got clear off. As she had
spoken of the savouriness of "Jew's fish" (cooked in oil)
it was surmised that she would go to Rag Fair, and
her ill-used friend, therefore, got upon the roof of an
omnibus, in hope of seeing her upon the way. In this
he was disappointed, and, therefore, walked about the
fair for some time. He was about leaving in despair,
when he noticed, in the distance, a girl of her style, but
of strange appearance, and upon approaching he found
that it was her, but so changed that he could not refrain
from laughing as he seized her arm. Her clothes had
evidently been changed,&mdash;in place of the neat little frock,
she had put on a dirty sky-blue silk, which was much
too large; upon her feet were a pair of green boots, and
upon her head a straw hat with large red feather. In
one hand she held a piece of greasy fish, and in the
other a green parasol.</p>

<p>In reply to the question, "What have you done with
the dresses?" she replied, "'Eld 'em up 'ere, and a
woman gave me ninepence for the silk un, and two
shillings for the t'other; and I've bin in and bought
these 'ere pretty clothes; and I've had lots of fish and
taters and beer, and was a-goin' to the gaff."</p>

<p>This statement was made in such a disingenuous manner
that it seemed evident that the poor child, like the
heathen, had no moral sense. As it was useless to try
and trace the dresses, it only remained to march her off
to the Refuge, where, out of consideration to her friend,
she was at once received. We may add, that she did
well in the Institution for several years, and that she
became a good general servant.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span></p>

<p>This girl was one of seventeen outcasts whom the
keeper of "Teddie's Den" brought to the Missionary,
all of whom were rescued; but though a "helper" in
the good work, he did not obtain spiritual good himself.
At times he seemed to tremble when passages concerning
judgment and mercy were read from the
Book; and he treated the Reader with respect,&mdash;but
that was all. The dreadful influence of his business and
the love of liquor quickly removed all good impressions,
and he continued to do evil: "He saw the better,
yet the worse pursued." Bad as he was, he at times
showed a kindness of disposition quite out of keeping
with his appearance and character; for instance, when
he heard that his friend was ill, he went to Covent
Garden Market, and, of all things there, bought a pomegranate,
and left it at his house. A few nights after this
he was in liquor, wandered from his door, and leaning
against an area gate which was unfastened, fell back
upon the stone steps. He fractured his skull, remained
unconscious for some hours, and died in that state. The
grief of the Missionary was great; he had diligently
sought the salvation of the man, and he, therefore, felt
crushed beneath the discouragement. The evangelist
has his trials and heart-sorrows, his disappointments are
frequent and painful, though not so often referred to as
they perhaps ought to be. It is a fearful thing when the
words he utters become "the savour of death unto
death;" but he has no choice in this matter, as the
order of the great Master is: "Thou shalt go to all that
I shall send thee; and whatsoever I command thee,
that thou shalt speak."</p>

<p>The "missus," for no one seemed to know her name,
succeeded to the full control of the den, and it soon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
became evident that she was hardened rather than softened
by the wretched end of her husband. She expressed
a positive dislike to the man whose faithfulness
was no doubt a difficulty to her, and she hindered his
efforts to do good.</p>

<p>"The master was a fool," she observed, a few weeks
after his death, "to bring you back here, as it's ruination.
After you left the t'other night the people was all glum;
and now gents as has lots of money to stand treats
doesn't come, as they are affeard of meeting you; and I
have got a man a-coming to help as will turn anybody
out, and you shan't come."</p>

<p>This was no doubt her determination, but the Missionary
had obtained such power with the supporters of the
place, that they would have defended him from insult,
certainly from violence. All knew him as one able to
rescue them, and as the only one who sought their
spiritual good. Bad therefore as they were, they felt
that the friend of the soul was their best friend, and they
treated him as such. All then that the "missus" could
do was to keep him at times out of the back room.</p>

<p>A change, however, passed over the place as the class
of customers gradually altered. The depraved became
fewer in number, while the skilled criminal class increased.
Magsmen and well-dressed pickpockets were
more frequently to be seen there, while the thieves,
among themselves, spoke of the woman as a good "fence"
(<i>i.e.</i>, a person who stands between the thieves and
receivers, and renders detection more difficult). The following
incident will show the class of customers:&mdash;</p>

<p>One night a Clergyman, who is now a dignitary of the
Church, visited there with the Missionary. The shop
was unusually full of youths and men of the criminal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
class, but in the farther corner sat a party of three persons
who appeared to be separated from the rest of the
company,&mdash;a man, woman, and little girl of twelve years.
They were leaning forward as if asleep, but were aroused
by the laughter produced by the pleasant remark the
Missionary made concerning "the wisdom of the owls
of night."</p>

<p>"What are you doing here with that child?" inquired
the Clergyman.</p>

<p>"Please, sir," replied the woman, "we has been very
unlucky, cos as how my husband has been ill, and all
our sticks was took for the bit of rent, and we begged
sixpence, and has had some tea and is stayin' here till it's
light; and if my old man doesn't get work to-morrow
we shall go next day to the Union over Battersea."</p>

<p>"You had better go there at once," he replied; "but
don't expose the child to the night air. If you will promise
me to save enough for a lodging, should you be
out to-morrow night, I will give you half-a-crown."</p>

<p>The promise was made and the money given, though
the quick eye of the experienced visitor saw by the
glances interchanged between the company that deceit
was being practised. The money was not, however
lost, as that congregation of the ungodly listened with
deep feeling to the clear, loving utterances of Divine
truth which fell from the lips of that good minister of
Christ Jesus.</p>

<p>Next evening the Missionary called in and inquired
of the "missus" what was done with the half-a-crown.</p>

<p>"We had a bottle of gin with it," she replied, "but
some of the fools wouldn't have any and went out, and
said it was a shame to cheat such a good Missionary-man
as him was that gived it."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span></p>

<p>"Now tell me," he continued, "who that man, woman,
and child were? I am certain that they are not vagrants."</p>

<p>"I should think not," the woman replied laughing:
"why they are smashers (<i>i.e.</i>, makers of counterfeit
money), and they sends the girl in first, who has bags of
bad money under her frock, and one of 'em comes in,
and if it's all serene the t'other comes, and then they does
business. When you com'd to the door I tipped 'em the
wink, affore opening it, as they was then a-sellin' to them
chaps. One was a buying six-pennorth of shillings, and
another a shilling's worth of half-crowns, according to
quality, as the saying is."</p>

<p>Some further conversation followed, when the woman
had occasion to leave the room for a few minutes, the
visitor turned to the daughter and said:</p>

<p>"I am glad at what you told me a few weeks ago,
that you were always praying to <i>God</i> to make you His
child and to keep you from the evil to which you are
exposed. Now tell me if you have decided to serve
the Lord?"</p>

<p>"That I have, sir," she replied, her eyes filling with
tears. "Mother won't let me out of her sight; but for
two Sundays I have been to the chapel down the mews,
where I understand everything, and keep on praying;
and the gent spoke so beautiful last night that I want
to serve Jesus altogether."</p>

<p>She was encouraged in the wise choice she had made,
and the friend left, rejoicing that her heart, like Lydia's,
had been opened to receive the truth.</p>

<p>The coiners were not met with again; but quite a year
after, the governor of Norwich Castle, at the suggestion
of a magistrate who assisted him in many works of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
mercy, wrote, asking the help of the Missionary in finding
a home for a girl who, with her parents, had been
apprehended for passing base money. It appeared that
they left the girl in the distance, and each taking a
piece of bad money passed it upon shopkeepers. They
were stopped several times, but as a second piece could
not be found upon them they were not detained. They
were traced from London to Norwich, by the bad money
they had passed, and were apprehended at a lodging-house,
with the bags in their possession. The parents
were sentenced to nine months' hard labour each, and
the girl detained until a home could be found for her.
This was done, and she was passed up to London.
She was some time in the home, and then absconded;
but several years after she called upon the matron, and
invited her to come and see her husband, as she was
comfortably married.</p>

<p>Several years passed, during which time "Teddie's
Den" was visited with varying success, until the night
upon which the International Exhibition was closed.
The Missionary had arranged a tea in the building for a
thousand persons, and returned home very weary, to
find a thief in the house,&mdash;for there in the hall sat a
man who had been frequently convicted. He, with
evident feeling, said, "The 'missus,' sir, has bin bad all
the week, and she's wery bad now, and is a mumbling
your name; and the doctor has bin agin, and says as
you ought to be sent for, so I has come." He was
told to fetch a cab; but it was midnight before they
arrived at the night-house.</p>

<p>An anxious group of depraved persons were standing
at the door, but the visitor passed them in silence and
entered the back room. The scene which presented<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
itself was solemn indeed, for there, dressed, upon her
couch, in the pains of dissolution, lay the woman who
used to boast that she had kept dens for twenty-one
years, and had not slept at night during that time. She
appeared to be dying, but rallied when she heard the
voice of her friend, and whispered, "Mercy! mercy!&mdash;Pray,
pray!"</p>

<p>"I tell you again, that as a guilty sinner, you must
pray for yourself," he replied, in a slow, quiet, tone.
"The blood of Jesus can save you now: ask God in
His name to pardon you." And then the dying woman,
after him, repeated short prayers. After a pause he
took her cold hand in his, and kneeling down, implored
pardon for her from the God of all grace. His voice
was, however, stopped by the sobbing of several women
and young thieves who had entered from the shop. The
death-expression upon the face of their old acquaintance
in guilt, with the solemn attitude and words of prayer,
overcame them, and they seemed to kneel as in contrition
before their offended Maker.</p>

<p>There were intervals of consciousness, during which
words of hope were read from the Book of Life; and
at her request, expressed by movements of her hands,
prayer was again offered. She soon became unconscious,
and expired at three o'clock.</p>

<p>A few comforting words were spoken to the weeping
daughter and the women who remained in the room;
and the night-visitor then passed into the street. A
large crowd of the criminal and depraved had assembled
from other night-houses, and as he left they made a
passage for him to pass through, while the two policemen
turned on their bull's eyes to light him on his way.
He, however, stepped back, and standing upon the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
threshold of the den, held out his Bible, and said, "She
is dead, and her eternal state is fixed: you, however,
are upon the side of the grave where mercy can be
sought and found. Look up, now, to where the Saviour
is seated, at God's right hand, beyond those dark clouds.
Be in earnest in seeking salvation, and then live for the
hour of death and the day of judgment." He then
passed down the street in silence, not a word reached his
ear from that gathering of the wicked.</p>

<p>The wretched inheritance descended to the daughter,
now a young woman of twenty. Before her mother's
illness she had suffered persecution from her, because
she boldly confessed faith in Christ. Another cause of
offence was her receiving tracts and placing them upon
the tables before the customers were admitted. She,
however, showed such dutiful affection to her mother,
that it no doubt softened her hard heart, and caused
her to show a better feeling towards the unwelcome
visitor. A few evenings after the funeral she called
upon her friend, and upon entering the room burst into
tears, and said, "I can't, sir, keep the dreadful place
open, for I am always praying, and the language and
sin is awful: I will beg my bread first. What shall I
do?"</p>

<p>She was soothed, and a quiet conversation took place
between them concerning her position. After conferring
with his wife, he said, "You are painfully circumstanced,&mdash;no
one would receive you into their service
if they knew that you had been brought up in such a
place. We, however, will do what others could not, as
I am assured that the Lord has dealt mercifully by you.
We need a servant, and will take you into our house."
She, with expressions of gratitude, accepted the offer;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
so he wrote notes to the landlord of the house, and to a
broker, and sent her with them.</p>

<p>Next evening the Missionary paid his last visit to
"Teddie's Den." A hand-cart was at the door, and the
broker inside. The furniture, crockery, and fixtures
were quickly sold and removed, and then the night
visitor and its late mistress left. It was with a joyous,
thankful heart, that he closed the door behind them,
for he felt that a stronghold of sin and Satan had fallen
before the silvery notes of the Gospel of peace.</p>

<p>The young woman did well in her place, and gave
evidence of a renewed nature. After a few months, her
master and mistress were so well pleased with her, that
they recommended her into a reformatory institution as
under matron. For two years she filled the office with
credit to herself, and to the spiritual benefit of many of
the inmates, including one who used to frequent her
parents' den. This woman had for years been the companion
of thieves, and had by vice so injured her health
as to suffer long illness in the London Hospital. Upon
her discharge she was sent to the Institution, and great
was her astonishment to find the young woman who,
when a girl, waited upon her at night, an under-matron
in the home of Mercy. From her she gladly received
the good news of Jesus receiving sinners, and was led to
call upon His name, and then to rejoice in His mercy.</p>

<p>One evening the young assistant called upon her
friend, and said timidly, "You know Mr. So-and-so,
don't you, sir?"</p>

<p>"I do," was the reply; "and think well of him."</p>

<p>"You have been more than a father to me, sir; and
will you please give me away?"</p>

<p>The office was cheerfully undertaken, and readily<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
fulfilled. After the marriage, the Missionary friend
and father handed her a Bible, with this writing in it:
"Heirs together of the grace of life." The union is a
happy one, and she is a living proof that sovereign grace
can raise its subjects from the lowest depths, and place
them among the princes of the children of light.</p>

<blockquote><p>"The seed is the Word of God." <span class="smcap">Luke</span> viii. 11.</p></blockquote>

<div class="drop">
<img src="images/idrop_t.jpg" alt="T" width="66" height="107" class="cap" />
<p class="cap_1">TWO hundred and sixty nights occupied in
evangelizing efforts in the streets, refreshment
houses, and dens of the mighty city,
gave evidence that the Word of God is
powerful to arrest the attention of the most
thoughtless&mdash;to stop the guilty in their downward
career; and that it is the power of God
unto the salvation of sinners who are sunk so low as
to cause them, when restored, to stand out before men
as miracles of mercy. Disappointments were frequent,
and if continuance in the work had depended upon
known success, would have been crushing. This however
was not so: the great Master does not send out
His servants at their own cost. When He, of His
sovereign grace, takes a sinner and places him among
His children, and then by distinguishing favour makes
him a wheel or a lever in His great machinery of mercy,
He only requires faithfulness&mdash;not success. Men can
only fill the office of subordinate instruments and visible
agents in the mighty process of salvation. "God was in
Christ Jesus reconciling the world unto Himself," but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
"He has committed to us the ministry of reconciliation."
This truth ought to remove indolence and avarice from
those who are named by the name of Christ. The
redeemed people who realize the debt they owe unto
their Lord, should covet to be the deputies and agents
of Divine love; such should labour and study, and pray
for success, because the Holy Spirit works by instruments
made fit for His use, and the armed omnipotence
of God is engaged on behalf of repentant sinners. The
great restoring work is of God, and of God only; and it
is therefore the duty of His servants to labour as cheerfully
when denied, as when favoured with evidence of
blessing.</p>
</div>

<p>These thoughts were suggested when materials for
this chapter were being collected. The mind reverted
to so many instances of failure,&mdash;to a succession of men
and women who had been the objects of much earnest
effort, but who had passed from under the influence
of the Missionary without giving the remotest hope of
their salvation. If a proportion of them were referred
to, this would be a dismal record. We will only therefore,
by way of illustrating the nature of the work, refer
to one instance.</p>

<p>A Cabinet Minister had conferred with the Missionary
upon the matter of legislation for night-houses; and as
other interviews were sure to follow, he thought it well
to visit all such places of which the police could give
him information.</p>

<p>One night he followed several fashionably dressed
gentlemen into a house near the Haymarket, and found
himself in a gilded saloon, with billiard rooms upstairs.
The gentlemen remained together, and as the visitor
felt strange, he went to the upper end and threw himself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
upon a couch; he was meditating as to what he could
do there, when a middle-aged gentleman entered and
gave a familiar nod to the group, and then glancing
keenly toward the stranger, approached and took his
seat at the other end of the couch. After a little
thought, an envelope containing a tract was handed to
him. He gave a sudden start, and the Missionary in a
merry tone, exclaimed "It's not a writ;" and then both
laughed heartily. The attention of the proprietor and
his waiter in full dress, had from his entering in, been
fixed upon the stranger; he therefore thought it well to
make friends with the gentleman, and pressing near
to him, he said, in a confidential half-whisper: "Oblige
me by not opening the envelope now, as it only
contains a religious tract." As he looked at it with
astonishment, the giver continued: "You no doubt
think it absurd, quixotic of me to venture in here with
tracts, but you will respect my motive when I tell you
that I have for years visited the lower class of night-houses,
and conferred benefits upon many; and that I
am the voice of one crying in the night season, 'Behold
the Lamb of God that taketh away the sin of the
world.'"</p>

<p>"A motive so good, justifies the act," replied the gentleman.
"I am going over to the Turkish saloon, and
will pass out with you."</p>

<p>In the street they fell into a pleasant chat, and an
appointment was made for another night; this was kept,
and followed by several others, besides chance meetings.
From his friends he ascertained that the gentleman was
supposed to be of good family, that he had graduated at
Oxford, and that he bore the assumed name of Clifford.
He was a most fascinating person, though his countenance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
had a dissipated and at times malicious expression.
He had a large acquaintance among young men of position,
who at that time frequented the Haymarket, and
was often seen with a gentleman, now deceased, who
by bad company lost his fortune, and had to sustain a
long law-suit to prove his sanity. By the lower order of
the depraved he was regarded as one of quite a large
number of gentlemanly men whom they called "pigeon
pluckers."</p>

<p>One night the gentleman and his Christian friend,
who had met in the Haymarket, were conversing
together, when he was accosted by a young man who
appeared to be of age, with "Ah, Clifford! how'do?
glad to see you. Just a word at your leisure."</p>

<p>"Certainly, my lord," was his reply. "I will be with
you in a few minutes: should have been waiting for you,
had I not met with this very pleasant friend."</p>

<p>"As Clifford's friend, may I crave the honour of offering
my hand to your lordship?" inquired the Missionary.</p>

<p>"Certainly," replied the young nobleman (if such he
was), and then the Christian visitor grasped his hand,
and holding it with mild restraint, looked him full in
the face, and said, "You are in danger, my lord. This
dissipation will injure your person, your good name,
your fortune, and perhaps your country. Be wise.
Like a certain young ruler mentioned in the Gospel,
approach the Lord Jesus, and ask, 'What shall I do to
inherit eternal life?'"</p>

<p>A deep colour rose to the face of the young man, and
he stepped hastily away; but turning back, as by sudden
impulse, he again offered his hand to his reprover,
and said, "I thank you, sir;" and was then lost in the
crowd of the gay and dissipated.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">&nbsp;</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 325px;">

<span class="caption">&quot;You are in danger my lord.&quot;</span>

<p>Some weeks after this event, the night visitor met the
gentleman, and had tea with him in a caf. As they sat
together at the small round marble table, the Missionary
observed, "To me it is astonishing that you can live
such a life as you are doing; heaping up wrath against
the day of wrath. From a child you have known the
Holy Scriptures, and I am surprised that texts do not
at times rise to your memory, and produce a fearful
looking forward to judgment!"</p>

<p>"Such is not the case," he replied, "strange as you
may regard it. There is only one matter of memory
which ever troubles me, and that is the verses of a child's
hymn which our mother used to teach us as we knelt at
her side in the nursery,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">

<span class="i0">'Almighty God, Thy piercing eye</span><br />
<span class="i1">Strikes through the shades of night;</span><br />
<span class="i0">And our most secret actions lie</span><br />
<span class="i1">All open to Thy sight.'</span><br />
</div>

<p>"At times these verses flash across my mind at most
inconvenient seasons, and destroy my enjoyment; they
occurred when you first spoke to me in the saloon, and
the other night I caught myself repeating them when
playing an important game of billiards." The pocket
Bible was produced, and the words solemnly read,&mdash;"He
hath appointed a day in the which He will
judge the world in righteousness by that Man whom He
hath ordained; whereof He hath given assurance unto
all men in that He hath raised Him (Jesus) from the
dead."</p>

<p>The visitor then repeated to him the verses of a Judgment
Hymn of his own writing, which evidently made
a deep impression:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>&mdash;</p>

</div></div>

<p>After this visit there were several other meetings, and
then a long interval occurred. Upon inquiring for his
friend at the divans and saloons, the visitor was told
that "he had not been seen for some time: that he had
no doubt gone upon the Continent, and would turn up
next season." He was not there the following year, and
was never seen in his old haunts again. It was with
him as with others,&mdash;much effort without apparent result;
and yet it is possible that, in the day of the Lord,
good concerning some of them will be made manifest.</p>

<p>In one class of cases there is freedom from discouragement,
and that is when the Christian worker is enabled
to strengthen, to encourage, and to assist disciples in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
their efforts to give a testimony for the Lord, and to do
good under depressing circumstances.</p>

<p>It was certainly thus with an old man who kept a
coffee-stall in a poor neighbourhood. His shop consisted
of a large barrow with canvas covering, supported
at the corners by upright pieces of wood. At
one end he had a small iron stove, with a large kettle
upon it, and a coffee-pot on one side and tea-pot upon
the other; at the farther end was a cupboard well filled
with bread-and-butter and plum cake. Upon the centre
of the barrow was a white cloth, covered with cups and
saucers, and underneath were several pails of water.
He used to wheel the whole concern to his corner as
soon as the clock struck twelve at night, and wheel it
away when the public and coffee-houses opened at six
in the morning. The acquaintance of the proprietor
was made in the following manner: One bitterly cold
morning, about three o'clock, the Missionary, who was
trembling from the chill felt upon leaving a warm night-house,
approached the stall, and held his hands to the
fire. The policeman on duty paused for the same purpose,
and the following conversation passed between
them:&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Stall-keeper</i>: "I have read the book you lent me, and
don't think the doctrine sound. Sovereign grace fore-ordained
unto salvation, and the saints elected according
to the Divine purpose must be saved. No man can
pluck them out of the Saviour's hands."</p>

<p><i>Policeman</i>: "You make too much of your favourite
doctrine of election. Our Lord died for all who ever
lived or shall live in the world; and it is written that it
is not the will of God that any should perish, but that
all should come to repentance."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span></p>

<p>"Both doctrines are plainly taught in the Divine
Word," remarked the stranger; "and, like the colours
in the rainbow, they harmonize and blend over the
throne where Jesus is seated. We do well to seek for
the full assurance of faith, and to rejoice in the sure
covenant; but while doing so let us witness for the
Lord who bought us, and try to win others by testifying
of His abounding grace."</p>

<p>With a happy smile the policemen recommenced his
weary walk round the beat, while the stall-keeper and
the night-visitor had pleasant converse about the grace
of our Lord Jesus Christ, which hath appeared unto all
men. This led to a friendship with the stall-keeper,
who was a Cornish man and a Calvinistic Baptist; and
to a slight acquaintance with the policeman, who was
a Congregationalist. Several visits were paid to the
"Coffee Man," as he was called, and work was appointed
him in the great vineyard. He was supplied
with tracts, which he kept in his cupboard, and for
several years he was a valuable distributor. Groups
of depraved people, who "make night hideous," used
to surround his stall; to these he gave tracts, and
spoke the truth boldly. He indeed became a kind of
spiritual adviser to the depraved. Many repentant
ones spoke with confidence to the good old man, and
several were sent by him to his friend, and were placed
in institutions of mercy.</p>

<p>This was not a solitary instance of converted men
being found in night occupations; and it became an
object of the visitor's efforts to strengthen such in the
faith, and to lead them boldly to witness for their Lord
in the midst of the ungodly. These helpers were precious
and their testimony valuable, because the great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
body of persons met with were disreputable or utterly
vile. Many were ignorant of the true light, but there
were others who had received religious advantages, and
who, by rejecting proffered mercy, counted themselves
unworthy of eternal life. Among this mass of the
unholy were to be found the young, the thoughtless,
and the distressed, who being easily led captive by
the devil and his servants, supplied the places of those
who were constantly sinking to perdition. With some
of these the work was effectual for good, as the following
case will illustrate.</p>

<p>One night, a little after eleven, the Missionary was
walking down Oxford Street, in company with another
evangelist, when they passed a girl of seventeen, who
was walking slowly, as if ill. The night visitor glanced
at her, and was struck by the expression of misery and
disease,&mdash;it seemed as though the sorrows of a life had
been concentrated in that young face. He therefore
turned suddenly, and approaching her, said kindly,
"Don't be afraid: I am a religious man, and a friend
to poor girls in trouble. Now do tell me where you are
going?"</p>

<p>"To sleep under the trees in the park, sir, if I can get
in," she replied; "if not, to walk about all night;" and
then she burst into tears.</p>

<p>In answer to inquiries, she made the following statement,
in a very truthful manner. She said, "I am a
village girl, and came from home after losing my only
parent about eighteen months ago. A neighbour's girl
who was in London got me a place. It was at a lodging-house:
and I rarely got out, as they only let me
go to church three times. All the stairs were of stone,
and I had to clean them; this, with constant running up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
and down, brought on a white swelling in my knee. I
remained as long as I could crawl, and then, as I had
saved three pounds, went to live with the charwoman.
After a time I went into an hospital for two months.
I returned to the charwoman, and tried to get into
place, but I looked so ill that no one would engage me.
After the money was spent I pawned my clothes, and
I was told to go to the workhouse. I went to the door,
but the man spoke so sharp to me that I drew back,
and now I have been in the streets for two days. Last
night I slept with some other girls under the trees in
Hyde Park, but they talked so dreadful that I am
afraid to go in again. Oh! what shall I do?" and then
she sobbed so loudly that several persons crossed from
the other side of the street.</p>

<p>"If your tale is true, I will provide for you," said her
interrogator: "at all events I will see that you are
taken care of to-night." He then took her to a coffee-house,
where he was known, and paid for a supper, bed,
and breakfast. At leaving, he took an envelope from
his pocket, and tearing it, gave her one-half, and said,
"Stand with this in your hand near the fountain in
Regent's Circus to-morrow morning at ten o'clock, when
a lady with the other half will speak to you, and take
you to a Home."</p>

<p>At the appointed time the poor girl approached the
fountain, where a matron of the Rescue Society was
waiting to receive her. As soon as she reached the
Home her statements were inquired into, and found to
be correct. Care and proper treatment soon restored
her to health, and a lady received her into her service.
Three months after the lady called at the office to
thank the secretary for sending her such a good servant.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
She remained in her place several years, and gave evidence
of real gratitude for the great deliverance which
had been wrought out for her.</p>

</div>

<p>The state in which this poor girl was found illustrates
the lonely condition of those who are friendless in a
great city. The most wretched and deserving may
in the crowd jostle against the best and kindest of men
and women, and yet be sinking to the lowest depths
of wretchedness and vice, unnoticed and uncared for.
Hence the Christian duty and true philanthropy of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
arresting such wanderers, and putting them in a position
to live godly, righteously, and soberly in this
present evil world. The following case will show that
such efforts are not lost, and that the words of the
Book are powerful to reclaim even outcasts:&mdash;</p>

<p>One morning a ragged, wretched-looking girl of nineteen,
was brought to the house of the night visitor by
a woman of depraved and drunken appearance, who
said, "This 'ere young woman was a-going mad, and
fainted like, when she ran into the night-house, and
said as how she wanted the parson man, who preaches
like out of the Bible in the streets at night; and as
that's your honour, I found out that you lived here,
and so I've brought her. I had to treat her, as I has
good feeling, and the men wanted to take her to the
police, as she is mad, and I think she ought to be took
to Bedlam."</p>

<p>The object of this speech stood with her hands before
her face, trembling with emotion. Filthy as she was,
the Missionary and his wife took her into a private
room, and by soothing words drew from her the following
statement. She said, "I am a Scotch girl, and
my father is a tradesman in a large way of business.
In a bad temper I absconded from home, and have
been awfully wicked. One night I heard you speak to
some people round a coffee-stall, and then you showed
us the Bible, and said that every word in it would come
true, and that Jesus would come again as a thief in the
night. At leaving, you said that 'the heavens would
pass away with a great noise, and that the earth would
be burned up, and that all who rejected mercy now
would then be banished from the Saviour's presence.'
I felt so miserable that I went to my lodging, and next<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
day I wrote to my father, asking him to forgive me.
He did not write for two days, and I was so anxious
that I stood for hours looking for the postman. At last
a letter came in his handwriting, and the only words
in it were, 'You are no daughter of mine: never write
to me again.' I felt mad when I read it, and walked
about Regent's Park all day: when the gates were shut
I hid myself, and went to sleep on the grass. I woke
up in the night, as it was raining, and I was soaked
through. As I crossed the bridge I began to laugh and
dance, and thought how nice it would be to drown myself;
so I took off my bonnet and shawl, intending to
jump in, when I thought I heard you speaking of mercy
and Jesus, and was so startled that I took up my things
and ran as fast as I could. I jumped over the palings
as though some one was after me, and ran until I got
to the night-house, and then I fainted." At the end
of this recital she looked wildly round, and almost
screamed, "Oh, save me, sir: do save me! don't let
me go into the park."</p>

<p>She was assured of her safety, and words of Christian
tenderness were spoken to her. After partaking of
refreshment she was sufficiently calm to be sent in
charge of the woman with a note to the manager of the
Refuge for the Destitute. She was received, and next
morning, being ill, was taken into an hospital. Her
father was written to several times, but did not reply
to the letters: a maiden aunt, however (those blessings
in a family), sent for her into Scotland. A week after
a very grateful letter was sent by the aunt, inclosing full
payment for expenses incurred in the rescue of her
niece: also a letter from the girl, expressing thankfulness
to God and man for her wonderful deliverance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
from a watery grave. After these no other voluntary
letters were sent. When he wrote, the replies were
so cold and short as to give him to understand that
though thankful, they wished to break off from all who
knew of her dreadful fall.</p>

<p>Such and much worse instances of ingratitude, where
the greatest of blessings had been conferred, were not
uncommon. At first it was a real discouragement to
the man, who felt the sorrow and weariness of this
desperate struggle for souls; but at length he became
reconciled to labour as unto the Lord only. Even then
he at times felt saddened, after labouring for the good
of some apparently worthless person, to be avoided
after the good had been accomplished. It seemed like
the Gospel story of the ten lepers being healed, and
only one of them returning to give thanks to the great
Healer. The proportion of the unthankful is very large;
for out of the 374 women, girls, and boys, whom the
Lord enabled the Missionary to rescue, or to deliver
from some peril or misery, they are few indeed who
at the interval of years show gratitude. One of these
shall be referred to here, as the narrative also shows
that the blessing which gives success frequently rests
upon perseverance in effort to do good.</p>

<p>Upon a drizzly night, a beggar man and his boy of
thirteen years entered a public-house which remained
open until one o'clock in the morning. The man asked
alms of the publican, and then of the Missionary to
whom he was talking, and said that they only wanted
fourpence for their lodging, as they had tramped in from
Chatham, and were both ill. Out of pity to the boy,
who staggered from weakness, the visitor walked with
them to a "Traveller's Rest," and paid the money.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
Upon the way the man stated that he was a discharged
soldier, and had left the regiment through bad eyes; he
was nearly blind, and that he had a small pension for
the first year. His wife and themselves had lived pretty
well by begging in the country during the summer, as
he always wore a red jacket and carried his discharge
paper. On their way his wife had been taken ill, and
was left at an Infirmary; but he hoped she would soon
join them. He appeared very thankful when an offer
was made to place the boy in a Refuge, and a call for
that purpose was arranged for the next day.</p>

<p>"The Traveller's Rest" was situated in a low back
street, with several courts in it, and a passage at the
end. The road was offensively dirty, as the Missionary
passed down at two o'clock upon the next afternoon.
The swarms of children were of the gutter, shoeless,
tattered, and filthy. At many of the doors women of
debased countenances were squatted, smoking short
pipes. A fiddler was playing in the doorway of a low
beerhouse&mdash;"The Dan O'Connell,"&mdash;while men, women,
and children were dancing inside and out, to an Irish
jig. Out of two windows were long poles with bills
underneath, announcing the pleasing fact that a "clean
shave and a wash could be had within for one halfpenny."
These were no doubt rival barbers. "The
Rest" was one of several, and was offensively dirty. In
the back, or common room, were two tables and several
forms, the company consisting of eight women and five
men. Three of these were at the fireplace, one holding
a number of sprats upon a long skewer, another a red
herring, and the third was frying steak and onions.
They regarded the stranger with what he knew to be
a professional look, and one woman in the same breath<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
told him that "the sojer was upstairs, and that she was
very ill, and almost a skeleton with starvation;" and
then she took a bottle of medicine out of her pocket,
and to prove how bad she was, invited him to taste it.
This he courteously declined, and ascended to the
bedroom, the air of which was horribly offensive. A
row of old mattresses upon the dirty floor formed the
beds, while the walls were shockingly dirty. But as the
"soldier" said, "What 'commodation can a chap expect
for twopence, when you has the use of fire and water?"
To the disappointment of the visitor, the man began to
wriggle out of his promise to let the boy go to a Refuge;
and when pressed he became impertinent, and said,
"With my eyes bloodshot and the boy a-looking ill,
we can get lots; and I shan't starve for him." When
leaving, the reader re-entered the common room, and
secured the attention of the people to the parable of
the good Samaritan; and then, holding up the pocket
Bible, he said, "It's in here, and many other things
which the blessed Jesus spoke."</p>

<p>Some weeks after this the visitor saw the boy huddled
up in a night coffee-house, the father being fast asleep.
The lad told him that a lady in Upper Brook Street had
been very kind to them, but his father drank away all
the money. The address was taken down, and next day
the Missionary called upon the lady, who was so good
as to express her thanks, and they together planned the
rescue of the boy. By threats and entreaty the father
was prevailed upon to let him enter the Refuge in Commercial
Street, and the night visitor took him there in
triumph.</p>

<p>The lad did well in the home, and was initiated into
the mysteries of the two crafts of the shoemaker and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
carpenter. He did his work well, and showed a thankful
heart. He procured a slip of leather about nine
inches long, and wrought the name of his friend upon it
with shoemaker's thread, and upon one of his visits gave
it him, while the tears of gratitude stood in his eyes.
The visitor has it now among the precious memorials of
his work. Poor boy, he was without money with which
to buy a present, so he devised this in order to show
how warm his heart was.</p>

<p>Upon leaving the Refuge, he was apprenticed to a
master carpenter, the lady kindly paying a small premium
with him. He did well, and at the end of his
time entered a good shop of work. He occasionally
called upon his friend to report progress. After a long
interval he came back for a short time, and stated
that he had for eighteen months been a member of a
Presbyterian Church, and by giving tracts and by conversation
was trying to do good to others. It was a
pleasant interview, as the young carpenter thanked his
friend more warmly than ever for his rescue, and then
they knelt together in prayer. One instance like this
makes up for all the toil and sorrow of the work, and
leads to humiliation before Almighty God, that He
of His great mercy should use earthen vessels for the
purposes of His grace.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>We cause a gap in this chapter, in order to make
an important announcement,&mdash;an announcement which
deserves to be printed in large type, and blazoned in
letters of gold; it is, that as London never sleeps, so
<span class="smcap">the large Church of God in the mighty city
never sleeps</span>. There are now many workers for Him
in the night season, and the call of sinners to repentance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
never ceases in the empire city. The happy result was
brought about in this way: People heard of and became
interested in the work of the midnight visitor. First
among them was a clergyman of importance, then at
a college in Oxford. He wrote to the Missionary, asking
him during the week of the Cambridge and Oxford
boat-race, to give letters he had written to any young
gentlemen he might find in casinos, saloons, and night-houses,
wearing the dark-blue necktie. Several nights
were thus occupied with interest and profit.</p>

<p>Soon after this, the founders of the midnight meeting
movement consulted him about that project, to which
he gave his hearty support. Upon the first night he
gave away the invitations, and for that purpose penetrated
places into which no one but himself dare have
entered with that object. The large room was crowded,
not less than 250 young women were present; and he
stood rejoicing with prayerful heart beside the Hon. and
Rev. Baptist Noel, while he gave the first address. The
midnight visitor knew that a movement was then being
inaugurated which would continue to recover many from
destruction, and which would raise the moral tone of
London. Several private individuals now commenced
visiting at night, and the Committee of the London
City Mission had compassion upon their overworked
servant, and by the appointment of a Missionary to
night-houses, relieved him of these self-imposed duties.
A change of importance had however been brought
about. His evidence before a Committee of the House
of Commons, his writings and private influence, had its
share in securing a beneficial Act, closing night-houses
from one until four o'clock in the morning. This was a
great moral good, and it has resulted in the establishment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
of hundreds of street coffee-stalls. There is still
much room for Christian effort at night, as the following
extracts from printed statements of the two Missionaries
thus employed will clearly show. We introduce these
with an extract from "The Sword and Trowel:"&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>"The Missionaries invariably leave their homes at twelve o'clock
in the night, and return about eight o'clock in the morning. And
the number of cabmen is now so great, and their spiritual instruction
so much needed, that the effort has proved to be one of the
most necessary, as well as fruitful departments of evangelization.
There are nearly 2000 night cabmen. They are very docile, remarkably
glad to be taught the message of God's love. And,
indeed, the two Missionaries seem generally attached to them.
Being earnestly desirous for their best welfare, and remembering
how close death must be to most of these old men, these messengers
of peace yearn over their souls. In numbers of instances their
efforts have been blessed. Poor old men, down whose furrowed
cheeks the tears of penitence have flowed, have found in Christ the
truest consolation for their wearied hearts. In the hour of life's
eclipse&mdash;for death to the Christian is nought more&mdash;they have
witnessed a good confession, and have given bright and glorious
testimonies that they have been born again."</p></blockquote>

<p>One Missionary writes,&mdash;</p>

<p>"The coffee-stalls and booths which are to be found
all over London at the corners of the streets, and in
public thoroughfares, near railway stations, etc., are
excellent opportunities for usefulness. These are kept
by people who have no other means of obtaining a
livelihood, and who sell a cup of smoking hot coffee for
one halfpenny, and a slice of cake or bread and butter
for the same price. Many of these people are Christian
men and women, and render the Missionary great assistance
in expounding the message of mercy and salvation
to their customers. Not only cabmen and the outcast
get a cup of coffee at these places, but men in the building<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
trade, railway carters, and others, towards six o'clock,
gather round them in large numbers, to obtain that
which does them good and saves them from going to
the early public-house. So that these coffee-stall proprietors
are a really useful part of the community.
These coffee stalls have increased rapidly, so that now
about four hundred and sixty can be counted in the
streets of London at night. The Church of England
Temperance Society have also stationed a number in
leading thoroughfares by day. We give a picture of
one of these because it contains the latest improvements
and best use of them.</p>

</div>

<p>"On one occasion a pugilist gave me his address, and
told me that, when a little boy, his mother used to teach
him his prayers, some of which he repeated. He added<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
that he had got the best wife in the world, but he treated
her like a brute. I talked to the poor fellow till he wept
like a child, and he took hold of my arm and said, 'You
shall go home with me to-night.' I begged to be excused,
as it was now three o'clock in the morning. However,
there was no alternative, so off I went with him,
arm-in-arm. He called his poor wife up, although I
wished him not to do so; but so far from being angry
when she saw that my object was to try and reform her
husband, she thanked me with tears in her eyes. He
promised by God's help to seek to lead a new life, and
give his heart to God. As I had a Testament in my
pocket I gave it them, and we knelt down and prayed for
God's blessing on our meeting. I went home musing on
the event which had occurred, and could not help feeling
that the Lord had directed my steps back with the man.
I have called since, and find that by trade he is a sawyer.
He is now working at his trade, is a teetotaler, and in a
hopeful state of mind."</p>

<p>As some instances of usefulness have come under my
notice through the reading of the Word of God, I purpose
to refer to two or three:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Mr. &mdash;&mdash; has been a night cabman for thirty-six
years. In reply to my questions, he said he did not
remember when he last went to church, and if he was to
go, he is so deaf he could not hear the parson. I asked,
'How do you spend your time on Sunday evenings?'
'In reading <i>Lloyd's Newspaper</i>,' was the reply. 'Oh,' I
said, 'then you could read a Testament, if I got you
one?' 'I dare say I could,' was the answer. I took him
one, which he read, and he became so fond of it that he
soon laid aside the newspaper, and the Testament became
his constant companion. Although he is deaf, yet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
he now attends church, and is in a hopeful and penitent
state of mind.</p>

<p>"Mr. &mdash;&mdash;, poor man, was always full of trouble. He
had lost his wife by death, buried four children, and
broken his leg; and every time I attempted to converse
with him, he would pour his burden of troubles into my
ear, and think no one sympathised with him. I got him
a Bible, and turned down for him Isaiah liii., and several
other portions of God's Word, which he read. The next
time I saw him I heard but little of his troubles, and the
time after that he said, 'Sir, my Bible has quite cured
me of complaining, for when I read of what my Saviour
suffered, I feel ashamed to murmur or complain. It is
the Bible that has cured me, for I see others have suffered
before me, and that nothing has happened to me
but what is common to all men.'</p>

<p>"Poor old &mdash;&mdash; said, 'I have read your Testament all
through, and don't know what I should have done when
I was in the workhouse but for my book. I have been
thinking very much about our Lord's Sermon on the
Mount, and I feel that it condemns me, for I used to
think that I was not so bad as others, and that through
my own good works I should go to heaven. Now I feel
I am a sinner, and have no good works, and that it is
through the righteousness of another that I must be
saved. I asked the Chaplain in the workhouse, and he
explained the whole thing to me as clear as day.' I
have often explained to him the glorious doctrine of
justification by faith in the finished work and righteousness
of the Lord Jesus Christ, for which he is very
grateful.</p>

<p>"A man, named &mdash;&mdash;, said, 'Well, if your Testament
has done nothing else, it has kept me out of the public-house,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
and therefore it has done me good; and my wife
is pleased, I can tell you.' I advised him to go on
reading, and to seek the aid of the Holy Spirit to help
him."</p>

<p>As it is always pleasant to record increase of good, we
are glad to state here that a second and well qualified
Missionary has for several years been working at night in
East and South London, and that with marked success.
All the night cabmen and thousands of people to be
instructed in saving truth by night only are now under
visitation.</p>

<p>The following words from the pen of a clergyman's
wife (Mrs. Hebert), who has for years sustained this
good work, will form a most suitable conclusion to this
chapter:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Night after night the work has been going on, much
being done, as we have often seen, in a single night, and
the result is that many have found rest to their souls.
Prodigals have sought their Father's house, the afflicted
have heard the rod, the inquiring have been directed to
Jesus, and have found Him; the aged have been brought
in at the eleventh hour, and are spending their little
remnant of life to His glory who called them into His
vineyard. Let us give thanks and pray more. Let us
identify ourselves more in spirit with our Missionaries.
It is our work as well as theirs. We can only reach
these poor cabmen through them.... Missionary
work is so like Christ's work, and so great a blessing
rests upon it, that we should all seek to have a share
in it in our own way,&mdash;that is, in the way God may
have opened for us. Then we shall feel not only that
we are fellow-labourers with all who are seeking to
spread the Gospel, but, as it is so wonderfully said by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
St. Paul, we shall be 'workers together with Him' whose
word shall not return to Him void.... We have
all had our trials, like those whom we are seeking to lead
to the God of all comfort. Life and its treasures are
passing away, but the things which cannot be shaken
remain. God's work still claims us. We can still be
about our Father's business. And what is so elevating
and so soothing amidst cares and distractions and losses,
as the thought that there is a calm, holy, steady course
marked out for us by Him, and that He condescends
to be glorified by us, whether by our life, or by our
death?"</p>

<p class="cap_3">"MY saying is," observed the driver of an
omnibus to a gentleman at his side, "that
it is right to be sociable; for if we are to
have friends, we must be friendly ourselves."
"Capital remark, that," we thought,
while sitting down at the other side of the
rather elevated box, waiting an opportunity
to join in the conversation. The man was not quite
unknown to us, as, in our almost daily journeys to the
City, we had mounted at his side in turn with that of
other knights of the whip who drove omnibuses from
one of the suburbs to the centre of the mighty City&mdash;the
Bank.</p>
</div>

<p>Once before, a short terse sentence had, in our hearing,
been uttered by him which made a favourable impression,
and we were now certain that James was a character&mdash;a
man with an individuality. He was certainly
respected by his fellows, as, while many others had
singular names given them, expressive of peculiarities or
contempt, he was always addressed as James; and it
was certain, from the hurried words shouted by the
drivers as they rapidly passed each other, that he dared<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
to be singular by paying like respect to them. It was
thus that we got to know the christian or surnames of
men who were addressed by others as Kitty, Cranky,
Boosey; and even "Ugly Jib"&mdash;as a worthy man was
called in derision of a facial deformity&mdash;smiled pleasantly
as our driver, in cheery tone, gave the rapid word
of greeting, "Fine morning, Dan," or "Raw evening,

</div>

<p>A kindliness of disposition was also evident by the
style in which he handled the "ribbons;" with a care
and decision peculiar to the man, as though fearful of
jagging the horses with the bit. As for the whip, it was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
simply what he called it, "his ornament." To have
used it with violence upon his dumb friends never
entered his mind. This was evident one dreary night
when we had stayed late in the City, and happened to
be the only outside passenger. As the hill was ascended
near the end of the journey, the horses slackened pace
almost to a walk. Now, we thought, is time for use
of the "ornament;" and use it he did, but in a gentle
manner. Patting one horse upon the neck with it, he
said in an encouraging tone, "Now, Polly; come, get
on;" and then passing it over to the other, he stroked
kindly and said, "This won't do, Sally; come, pull up."
Then followed the "click, click, click," an accomplishment
of the mouth only attainable by the thorough "bus"
driver; and then the horses, as with a human sense of
the power of kindness, took the collar and cheerfully
capped the hill.</p>

<p>"And so you treat your cattle as young ladies, do
you?" we observed.</p>

<p>"Well, you see, sir," he replied, "as the saying is, 'the
man that's any good considers his beast;' and it answers,
as I can keep time as well as any one; and the
foreman of the yard never finds fault, as I run them
in quite comfortable, not all reeking and trembling as
some do. And then, when I go into the yard of a
morning, the pretty creatures look round and shake
their manes, as much as to say, 'Good morning, master,
we shall get on all right to-day.' You see, sir," he
continued, after a thoughtful pause, "I have two daughters
at home, Mary and Sarah, and good girls they are,
though I don't see much of them; and as I am always
thinking of them I mention them like to the horses
when I want to pull up to time and the like."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span></p>

<p>"Your daughters, I suppose, go out to some employment,
as you see so little of them?"</p>

<p>The answer was not immediately given, as the man
hung his head and with ill-concealed emotion said, "No,
sir, they ain't quite old enough for that; and I have
heard a saying that no good is got by showing your
sores, and 'that which can't be cured must be endured.'
You see, I have to work more hours a week than niggers
in the West Indies were ever made to do. Compared
with other working men, I do nearly two days' work in
one. This I have done for these sixteen years, and
very little I've seen of my family and home. I often
feel that I am getting used up, and think of a saying a
foreman of mine had for men who asked for a day off
the box: 'Rest indeed! rest in the grave, that will do
for you.'"</p>

<p>This reply was given in a tone of despair which
stopped the conversation for the short time required to
reach the end of the journey. The parting word of
"Good night, coachman," evidently helped him to regain
his usual cheerfulness, as we heard the shake of the
reins and the usual utterance, "All right, Sally; come,
get on, Polly."</p>

<p>With us, cheerfulness was not so easily regained. The
happy home and family joys seemed to deepen rather
than remove the impression made by the driver. "It is
now after ten," we thought, "and the poor fellow has
another journey to the City and back. On the box
again at eight in the morning until midnight, with little
prospect of a Sunday; well, we will speak to him upon
that subject."</p>

<p>A few nights after, being purposely late, we again
mounted beside our proverb-speaking acquaintance, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
watched for an opportunity to draw him out upon the
"rest-rights" of his class. This soon occurred, as the
driver remarked that his horses were fresh, "as they had
yesterday in the stables."</p>

<p>"And so they have a rest-day now and then," we
remarked, "and you have a natural and scriptural right
to one in seven. How often do you get it?"</p>

<p>"I've lost mine this many a long year," was the
reply; "and as they say somewhere, 'losers are always
in the wrong;' and so five thousand or more of us who
toil on the stones of London during all the Sundays are
in the wrong&mdash;of course we are&mdash;and being in for a bad
bargain must make the best of it. For us there is no
help, as saints and sinners are both against us."</p>

<p>"Saints against you?"</p>

<p>"Yes sir, begging your pardon, the saints, or that
sort of them that ain't advanced, and can't get on without
their ears being tingled. We who live all our
waking hours elevated on a 'bus observes a great deal,
and that there are two sorts of Christians. It is wonderful
if you compare duly what religion does. The
hundreds of gentlemen's carriages it keeps indoors; the
lots of working-men and city gents who can be happy
at home, and the wonderful number that goes to their
own places of worship, as is right. Well, these religious
riders are a strange set, they are indeed. Sometimes
they are ashamed of their prayer or hymn books, and
sometimes they show them off boldly. My conductor
was a Sunday-school boy not long ago, and he hates the
sight of them. Between the box and monkey board
there is an understanding, 'signs and wonders,' as I calls
them, and when a religious party gets in, he puts his
hands together and looks solemn; and when the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
pleasure-takers&mdash;our worst enemies&mdash;and there's no end
of them, he rubs his hands and looks jolly. Well, these
religious Sunday riders are a selfish, shabby lot; it's
quite common when they pay with a shilling for them
to say, 'Give me a threepenny piece, please, conductor.'
That, you know, is for the collection; but if he can
help it he don't give it them, as he is of my opinion,
that these people ought to keep to their own places of
worship, and not bring religion into contempt by supporting
Sunday labour. Well, but the Sunday pleasure
people are generous fools. They do a hard day's work
and pay for it, as they don't believe in the religious way<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
of being happy. At night the men put their wives and
children inside and get out here themselves smoking
hard after the drink they have had. Last Sunday night
two of this sort got up beside me, and one of them
swore badly, and offered me a cigar; but I said to him,
'The saying is, that "the tongue defiles the whole
body," and I don't care to smoke with a man that
curses.' Then he bullied me and threatened to inform
about me; and I thought afterwards that I had done
wrongly, as it is not doing my duty in that state of life
in which God has placed me (as the Catechism says) if I
offend riders; and as we outcasts&mdash;yes, I say outcasts,
as men who have no Sundays and no ministers to care
for them are&mdash;can't hope to be saved if God Almighty
does not have mercy upon them for doing their duty."</p>

</div>

<p>The last part of this speech, which had been delivered
at intervals between stoppages, was uttered with an expression
of despair which reminded one of the day's
sigh of the prisoner without hope. After a pause, the
remark was ventured, "But, James, you can surely get a
Sunday off whenever you like; it is only forfeiting the
day's pay; and as I have ridden with you for some time,
I had a thought of asking you to let me give you a Sunday,
you could then attend Divine worship?"</p>

<p>"Thank you kindly, sir," he replied; "but I could not
ask for more than one in two months or so, though we
are supposed to have every third or fourth Sunday. I
am feeling old, and a man ain't liked who is often off
his 'bus. The foreman would soon say that a younger
man was ready to take the reins; and then the workhouse,
its disgrace, and separation from as good a wife
as ever lived. No, sir, personal kindness can't do much
for us Sunday slaves. No! it's getting the public to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
feel that it's a disgrace to the riders, and an injury to us
poor fellows, that can alone do it."</p>

<p>Such were his opinions; but we soon after had the
satisfaction to know that he enjoyed one happy Christian
Sabbath, and upon several journeys we listened to his
quaint remarks upon preacher and sermons. An interest
in his spiritual state (which is always akin to real friendship)
resulted; and upon many occasions instruction
concerning personal salvation was given. The last ten
minutes of the journey, when we were often alone, were
valued, as, at intervals for more than a year, the good-natured
driver listened as a little child to the message
of a Redeemer's mercy. The summer and autumn had
thus passed away, and during the winter we seldom
rode with him, as his hours had been changed. Upon
one of these occasions he from cold spoke with difficulty;
but his weather-beaten countenance expressed
a quiet peace, as he said, "I got a day off last Sunday
week, and went to church twice. At night it was a
saying of Jesus that was preached about, 'Come unto
me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will
give you rest.' The sermon made me as happy as a
prince; and after supper my Polly read the chapter
through, where it is; and then I read a Psalm which is
like a prayer."</p>

<p>We had not after this many opportunities for conversation,
but frequently received his salute (the raising
of the whip to the hat) as we passed on other omnibuses.
One fine morning towards the end of the winter,
which had been very severe, upon mounting an early
'bus, we noticed a bow of <span class="smcap">Crape on the Whip</span>, and
inquired concerning it. "It's James as used to drive
this 'bus," the man replied with feeling; "but he is only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
one of the several old whips who have been done up this
horrid winter. He had sixteen hours a day on this box
for six weeks hard off, and had a bad cold; and when he
tried for a rest Sunday, so many wanted it that he was
snubbed, and was afraid of losing his whip, and so he
kept on till he couldn't do so any longer, and then he
took to his bed, and died in a few days."</p>

<p>The startling intelligence produced a sense of sadness
during the journey, and led to solemn thought with
desire to break fetters and let this order of Sabbath
slaves go free.</p>

<p>That <i>Crape on the Whip</i> spoke of injury done to a
man, and an important class of men, and that by a too
general habit of breaking a Divine law through love of
pleasure, or want of consideration.</p>

<p>To labour or employ labour on the Lord's day, unless
for purposes of necessity or mercy, is sinful; as the command
is, "Remember the Sabbath day to keep it holy,"
and "Thou shalt reverence my Sabbaths." It is a
breach of the moral law for mere pleasure to use any
kind of vehicle on "the day which the Lord has made,"
and given for rest and worship. Poor James, like thousands
of his class, was injured also by the criminal carelessness
of professed Christians. These Sunday riders
do spiritual and eternal damage to public servants, as
well as temporal wrong, for&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<span class="i0">"Evil is wrought by want of thought,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">As well as want of heart."<br /></span>
</div>

<p>That <i>Crape on the Whip</i> told the oft-repeated fact
that the body of the Sunday worker rests earlier in the
grave through loss of the Sabbath rest. The Maker of
our frame has declared cessation from labour during a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
seventh portion of our time to be necessary to its health
and vigour. The son of toil by hand or brain, who by
loss of, or misuse of, the rest day so graciously given,
impairs or fails to restore his strength, thus does injury
to himself and others.</p>

<p>That <i>Crape on the Whip</i> assumed the force of a call to
the Church, urging to self-denial and to active effort.
Shall public servants slave on for our convenience, with
no man to care for their souls? Let Christian men who
are brought into friendly contact with them answer
"No," by telling them of a Saviour's mercy. Let
workers in the Lord's vineyard seek opportunity to
instruct them, while making effort to lessen their hours
of toil. Numerous as they are, they are only part of a
class, including cabmen, railway servants, and others
who suffer the moral degradation of Sabbath slavery.
Their helpers, for instance the men who take charge of
the horses, are the hardest-worked men in England.
From early morning until late at night, all the year
round they toil on. One of them remarked, "Cursed
already, unceasing labour, and life used up early." A
City Missionary, in a yard he visits, has arranged for
eleven of these to join him on the Sabbath in an old
omnibus which stands in a corner of the yard. It was
once licensed to carry twelve inside. He there conducts
a little service with them. Then again there are servants
of the Redeemer who make constant effort to
bring the life-giving power of Christ's religion to bear
upon these Sabbath outcasts. Let us be partakers in
their struggles and joys until the victory is gained;
until freedom for those who cry because of the oppressor
is secured; until no conscience is troubled by <i>Crape
on the Whip</i> indicating that souls which were sabbathless<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
and uncared for had, <i>without</i> preparation, entered
the presence of God.</p>

<p>This earnest pleading for the oppressed omnibus men,
through the pages of the <i>London City Mission Magazine</i>,
reached many hearts with Christian sympathy, and
not a few resolved that these men also should be
spiritually cared for, and that an effort should be made
to improve their condition. An "elect lady" gave full
support for a Missionary to those who ply omnibuses in
the West, while the liberality of a gentleman abounded
to those of the South, and the help of many extended
the benefit to East and North London.</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 440px;">
<img src="images/i277.jpg" width="440" height="500" alt="Man beside two tired-looking horses" title="Man With Horses" />
</div>

<p>Welcomes, hearty and full of hope, were given by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
omnibus men to their new friends. Among their thousands
there was not a Church member, a "Church
goer," or one influenced by reading the Scriptures;
except two or three who worked for private masters of
Christian principles. To these Sabbathless men of constant
toil, the Gospel which speaks of deliverance through
the mercy of God in Christ Jesus was indeed a joyful
sound, and right glad were they while waiting for a few
minutes at each end of their journeys to listen to the
messengers sent to them with glad tidings, and the
result has been blessing to many souls, and the commencement
of a struggle for their Sabbath and social
rights.</p>

<p>A lady, for instance, offered a supper to three hundred
of the omnibus men of West London if they could be
got together. Lord Shaftesbury's advice was taken in
the matter, and he decided that it would be well to invite
them to the repast when they left work, from eleven to
half-past twelve at night. This was done. A large,
unfurnished room near the Paddington Station was
taken. Their Missionary delivered the invitations the
day before, and as midnight drew near the rush of men
proved that all had accepted them. The uninvited
guests, indeed, exceeded the invited, so the ample
supply of provisions were soon cleared off. Then a
raised platform was extemporized, and great was the
demonstration of delight when Lord Shaftesbury took
his stand upon it. The sight was of thrilling interest, as
his lordship was surrounded by a group of gentlemen
and ministers, including the Earl of Aberdeen and
Canon Fleming, and in front were a mass of omnibus
men, closely packed to the end of the room. The excitement
was great when the noble lord announced that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
"The Man with the Book," who wrote "Crape on the
Whip," would first address them.</p>

<p>This speaker, who was well received, stated the difficulties
of the men, and gave matured advice as to the
means of their removal. Referring to a conversation
he had held with a director of the company, he stated
that this gentleman admitted that the men were cruelly
overworked, and that they were, with few exceptions,
deprived of their natural and scriptural right to the
Sabbath rest; but that the evil resulted from the increase
of the Sunday riding public, and from faults
with the men themselves which riveted their fetters.
These faults were faithfully stated, and passages from
the Book of God were repeated and pressed upon their
attention, which, if believed from the heart, would lead
them to their God and Saviour, and so break these and
the heavier fetters of the soul, making them happy as
the freedmen of Christ.</p>

<p>Dr. Manning, of the Tract Society, Lord Aberdeen,
and Canon Fleming, then made pointed and telling
speeches, after which the noble chairman wound up the
meeting by telling the men that it was right that their
grievance of constant toil&mdash;long hours without Sabbath
rest&mdash;should thus be made known, that a healthy public
opinion might be formed on their behalf. From his
long experience in effort to reduce the hours of labour
he gave them valuable advice, and concluded with the
words:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>"I cannot find language strong enough to express all I feel at
constant labour being forced on men, not excepting the Lord's
day. It is abominable, and sufficient to call down the vengeance
of God on the country. The rest of the Lord's day is a great
necessity, and to deny you men the enjoyment and repose of that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
day is not only a very great cruelty, but an abominable sin (cheers).
I want to remind you of this, that this work which we are commencing
cannot be done by us alone; it must be done in cooperation
with you. You must support the effort by strong appeals
to your employers, and still stronger appeals to the public, and
by unceasing prayer to Almighty God. You must press on all the
rights you have, and which by God's grace you are determined to
enforce. Your sole reliance must be in the blessing of the Almighty.
To Him you must direct your thoughts and prayers, and draw down
His blessing upon the effort, and take to your consideration these
words which fell from the lips of many Protestant martyrs in their
great sufferings,&mdash;</p></blockquote>

<div class="poem">
<span class="i0">"'Although the day be never so long,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">"At last it ringeth to evensong.'"<br /></span>
</div>

<p>Great cheering followed, and after singing a hymn, the
meeting, to which additional hundreds of omnibus men
had flocked, separated at two o'clock in the morning.</p>

<p>But what good has resulted from this effort and
meeting?</p>

<p>Well, much. Employers are granting their Sunday
slaves concessions, slight indeed, but hopeful as to the
future. Many persons who used these vehicles on the
Lord's day have discontinued the practice. Some
drivers and conductors have left on Sabbath principles;
and, best of all, many of the men have already received
spiritual good.</p>

<p>This was certainly the case with old Ben, who had
driven to the Bank many thousand times, and who for
thirty-two years had never attended Divine worship.
He, indeed, held religion and religious people in derision.
The Missionary secured his attention, and one
day soon after the meeting, old Ben observed to him, "I
read the tracts now, sir, and a bit of the Bible, and mean
soon to get another Sunday off." He succeeded, and in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
the morning, the first time for so many years, attended
Divine worship. In the evening his wife went, and he
remained at home reading the Scriptures. He retired
to rest unusually happy, but to sleep the long sleep, as
in the silence of the night watches his immortal spirit
was summoned to the presence of God.</p>

<p>It is indeed well that at length these men should have
spiritual care, and that the "feet of those who carry
glad tidings" should make their way to those who are
in like condemnation. Now it so occurred that about
the same time that Christian attention was directed to
the neglect and wants of the men who labour upon our
<i>noisy highways</i>, the roads,&mdash;that a like attention was
called to those who pass life quietly on our <i>silent highways</i>,
the canals. These water ways of the metropolis
extend for several hundred miles through and about the
City and its suburbs, and connect and bring into communication
other great cities of the country. They are
traversed continually by barges, which besides much
merchandise contain a large floating population. Whole
families inhabit the small cabins, and they have been
described in the British Parliament as the most ignorant
and debased of the people. It was therefore decided
by the rulers of the mission to select a suitable man
from the ranks, and bid him to make known the Gospel
in the cabins, and on the towing paths.</p>

<p>The surprise at the lock of the Grand Junction Canal
was great indeed when a stranger boarded each of their
vessels, and addressed them as though they were old
acquaintance. It was evident at first that they did not
take kindly to the new friend. There were suspicious
looks, and such hints as, "There bees them as says we
are awful bad, and as puts us down in them papers as is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
in the publics." The zeal of the good man was also a
matter of jest with them; as when they saw the agility
with which he sprang from the tow-path to the barge,
and from boat to boat, one man said to the other, "he's
a jumping Jack, he is." The readings from the Bible,
appeals to conscience, and the gift of Testaments and
illustrated publications, soon won a way to their hearts,
and in the course of five months their "Tract Man"
became a popular personage, and this is how the fact
was discovered. Mr. Atkinson, late Mayor of Hull, who
superintends the work, gave a tea to as many boatmen
and their wives as happened upon a certain evening to
be at the Brentford Junction, and two hundred and fifty,
direct from their boats, assembled, and a rough company
they appeared.</p>

<p>Tea over, and justice was done to it, the meeting
commenced by their host taking the chair, and he, after
hearty words of Christian kindness, requested the man
who was known to carry a Book with him to address
them. This he did by telling them "that a few days
before he had read something upon an old tea-pot in
the Brighton Museum, which he would repeat to them,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<span class="i0">"'The loss of gold is much,</span><br />
<span class="i1">"The loss of health is more,</span><br />
<span class="i0">"The loss of Christ is such a loss</span><br />
<span class="i1">"That no man can restore!'</span><br />
</div>

<p>"And then he explained to them the value of money, and
the misfortune of losing it by accident, and the sin of
losing it by drunkenness and vice. The value of health,
and the folly of losing it by intemperance, smoking, and
neglectful habits. The value, the preciousness of Christ
as the Saviour of sinners, and the folly, the crime, of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
refusing the mercy of God by Him. The Book was then
produced, and the words read solemnly, "Behold the
Lamb of God that taketh away the sin of the world."</p>

<p>Their Missionary was then called upon, and the boat
people received him with a demonstration of delight.
His speech was simple in words, but full of Christian
affection for their souls, and of sympathy in the trials
of their calling. It was evident that they received him
as their own "parson man," as they drank in every word
he uttered, and with a great noise expressed their
delight with his speech. One of them indeed rose, and
with a stammering tongue said, "that he was a waterway
man, and like them all, he and his wife wanted to
see him often in their cabin, to read to them from the
good Bible, and to try and make them good, as he knew
he was doing to some of them."</p>

<p>At the close it was cheering to hear them trying with
all their will to sing, "Tell me the Old, Old Story," and
to notice their reverence during the closing prayer.</p>

<p>After the tea several letters were sent to the Office.
They were alike in style, and we select one to show
the progress which has been made with these rough
people.</p>

<blockquote><p>"Dear sir i right those few lines to you to thenk you for you
kingens for sending such a man to the Poor Boat Peple i think he
Just the man for it to Point them to the lame of god Wich taks the

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span></p>

<p>We will only add that a gathering from among the
boat people, as from the omnibus men, is being made to
the Lord Jesus, and as they approach Him, the Saviour,
their spiritual fetters are broken, and the outward fetters
of their calling fall away. Duty, compassion, patriotism,
require that these thousands of the oppressed should
have opportunity to worship Jehovah in His temple, and
to become acquainted with His laws, and the wonders
of His grace. Remember, oh ye people who have been
chosen and called to form the Church of the Redeemed
on earth; remember that it is your dignity, as well as
duty, to help all who are oppressed; everywhere to
proclaim the freedom of the kingdom "set up in the
earth;" that to you the enraptured words of the prophet
are addressed with royal command and sustaining
promises: "Thou mayest say to the prisoners, Go forth;
to them that are in darkness, Show yourselves. They
shall feed in the ways, and their pastures shall be in all
high places ... for He that hath mercy on them
shall lead them, even by the springs of water shall He
guide them."<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<p class="cap_5">"THEY that be wise shall shine as the brightness
of the firmament:" they who have
the wisdom of God in a mystery, or the
hidden wisdom,&mdash;the knowledge not to be
found by searching the works of creation,
or in the discoveries and developments of
science and philosophy. This wisdom cometh
from above, and is therefore communicated by the all-wise
and eternal Jehovah. This, and this alone, can enlighten
man spiritually, invest him with power to
comprehend the central and infinite in truth, and lead
him to the attainment of those graces and perfections
which can alone fit him for the reception of reflected
glory, and raise him to a place before the throne of ineffable
light and purity.</p>
</div>

<p>This wisdom (like its counterpart in the natural world,
the sun) casts rays of light, beauty, and restoration very
widely. When He, the essence of uncreated light, stood
with "the glory He had with the Father" veiled, as the
Teacher of men, He uttered a truth so mighty that
wherever it is repeated the darkness fleeth away; wherever
it is sounded forth with power, be it in the palaces<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
of kings, in the hovels of the poor, or in the deepest
recesses of moral corruption, the blackness of the shadow
of death which surrounds the immortal soul is dispersed
as by the voice of Omnipotence. Jesus said, "I am the
Light of the world: he that followeth Me shall not walk
in darkness, but shall have the light of life."</p>

<p>The Church militant, the royal priesthood, the ransomed
people, is an assemblage of individuals called out
of darkness into His marvellous light. This community
of the blessed occupies the place of the absent Lord,
and has to show forth His glory. As children of the
day, they renounce the hidden things of darkness; and
as vessels of mercy illuminated by Divine grace, they
show forth "the light of the Lord." They of necessity
do this by letting men see their good works, by reproving
sin, by giving instruction in righteousness, by holy
zeal in efforts to increase the kingdom of truth and
purity. Possessed themselves of the Word of God,
through which and by the Holy Spirit they are being
sanctified, they use that same word for purposes of the
grace of God which bringeth salvation. The Bible in
the hand of the Christian is as the wisdom of God in
the hand of Ezra, leading them "to judge;" to give
wisdom and prudence "to all such as know the laws
of their God, and to teach them that know them not."
Hence it is the duty and high privilege of each Christian,
be he minister or layman, ordained or unordained, to
communicate precious truths, to teach from the Holy
Scriptures which are able to make wise unto salvation,
through faith, which is in Christ Jesus.</p>

<p>We have a conviction that the individual members
of the Church have not yet risen to the dignity of
every man saying to his neighbour, "Know the Lord."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
This witnessing for God is not a professional matter,
but a religious duty. Masses of people in our great
cities perish for lack of knowledge, while many partakers
of precious faith are content to live without
an effort to add one immortal spirit more to the
ransomed from the earth. They, alas! are many
who are under the "woe" pronounced against those
"who live at ease in Zion." There are no laity in
the theocracy of grace. All are priests. And they
who have heard the call of Divine compassion, and
feel themselves sheltered in the covenant of love, are
commanded to say "Come," or for ever bear the reproach
of being unfaithful servants. This standing back
from the great conflict, this looking on instead of joining
in the holy strife, is a reproach to the royal people,
an injury to our neighbour, and a withholding of blessing
from this sin-stricken world. There is work for
all in the great vineyard, and opportunities for usefulness
are ever occurring. It is not those only who dwell
in squalor that require the Gospel: the respectable
mechanics, the trading and professional classes; yes,
and the educated, and the noble, and the princes of
the earth: all who have not passed into the kingdom
of grace need the same truth, the same restoring and
elevating force. While, therefore, it is right to send
the Gospel of the grace of God to the lower orders, this
does not <i>exonerate</i> from the duty of influencing the
other classes to the acceptance of truth and the practice
of holiness. The necessities of the world require that
every Christian should carry a pocket Bible, and study
how to use it well. Then would the kingdom of God
come with power.</p>

<p>There can be no doubt that the practical infidelity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
and viciousness of the classes immediately and very
much above them has a most injurious effect upon the
lower orders of society. The wealth of the rich is often
used to the demoralization of the poor, while skilled
workmen are the chief propagators of scepticism among
them. Those, therefore, who give themselves to the
labour and care of uplifting the very low, have a deep
interest in the religious elevation of the more refined
and educated, as the classes act with marvellous effect
upon each other. These considerations must be our
excuse for devoting this last chapter to narratives of like
Christian work among the more advanced in the social
scale. As infidelity is so terrible a foe, we commence
with two instances of recovery from its destructive
influence.</p>

<p>One evening the visitor had occasion to call at a
public institution, and stopped in the lobby to examine
a microscope and set of lenses. The optician showed
him a telescope by which he said stars at a great distance
could be seen and particulars accurately defined.
In answer to the inquiry, "If those distinguished by
the appellation 'telescopic stars,' and ranging from the
seventh magnitude upwards could be seen by it," he
gave a very clever answer, which led to a long and
pleasant conversation. At parting, the visitor observed
"that there was an instrument now much in use by the
'wise,' of higher range, and called by the name of
'faith,'&mdash;a gift of God, a power by which Christians
could look through the clouds, beyond the nebul, even
to the place where Jesus is seated at the right hand of
God."</p>

<p>The optician shook his head, and said that "he
believed in all that was true in creation, in all that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
could be demonstrated; but that his credulity stopped
at the uncertain."</p>

<p>The subject was renewed upon another visit, and
continued at intervals for some months; so that he
became well instructed in the principles of that faith
which is said to "abide" and to "dwell" in the true
Christian, and which the unbelief of men cannot "make
void." After a time the optician left the institution,
and was lost sight of for nearly three years. He then
addressed a letter to his friend of the telescope, from
Middlesex Hospital, telling him that he had suffered
sad reverses, and that he was a patient there with a
painful eruption; and added, "Through the mercy of
God I have obtained precious faith, and I hope to be
ever mindful that I can only conquer the enemy by
giving myself up, and entirely depending upon the
blood of the Lamb. I feel, my dear friend, what
tongue or pen cannot describe: I feel that I am preserved
by our blessed Saviour from that doom I so
deserved; and I now place all my dependence upon this
new Friend, and I trust that I may continue in the
faith, and rest in the Lord and wait."</p>

<p>When the visitor called he found him afflicted with a
kind of leprosy, being covered with sores from head to
foot. He however looked happy, and in the course of
conversation, observed, "That remark, sir, about the
telescope when you first spoke to me, was the leading
step in my conversion: I never lost its impression.
When I packed or unpacked the instruments I used
to think about it, and at last got to desire your statement
to be true,&mdash;that 'the Lord Jesus, by a power of
the soul, could be seen pleading for and saving sinners;'
but now, blessed be God, I feel that I have the heavenly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
gift, and pray for its increase." He recovered from his
disease, and has for years proved his faith by holy
living.</p>

<p>The other instance occurred in the International
Exhibition. A visitor who frequently embraced opportunities
to direct attention to some truth contained in
the good old Book, was one morning worming his way
through the machinery annex, when his progress was
stopped by a barrier. As it was the midday hour for
refreshment, the whirl and clatter was stayed, the
machinery being at rest. A man, a fine specimen of
the English mechanic, sat by the motive engine reading
Goldsmith's History of England. The visitor noticed
this, and, handing him a Gospel of St. John, said, "Here
is part of the great biography,&mdash;some leading passages
in the life of the King now crowned with many crowns;
but whose life here was a miracle, from the manger to
Golgotha."</p>

<p>"I have read it, sir," the man replied, taking the
book; "but I cannot believe all the Bible says about
Jesus Christ, and other matters."</p>

<p>"If you have time, I should like to know how it is
that you reject the testimony which <i>God</i> has given of
His Son?" said the giver of the Book, and the following
conversation took place:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Well, sir, this is how it is: I was religious in my
youth, but when an apprentice, my shopmates induced
me to attend theological lectures followed by debates.
These discussions shook my faith in the Christian
system, and the reading of books has strengthened
my convictions."</p>

<p>"This is a serious matter: do please tell me your
chief difficulty."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">&nbsp;</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 326px;">
<img src="images/i293.jpg" width="326" height="500" alt="&quot;It is your duty to connect the band of this engine with the various machines.&quot;" title="Conversing with the man at the machine" />
<span class="caption">&quot;It is your duty to connect the band of this engine with the various machines.&quot;</span>
</div><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274"></a></span></p>

<p>"Well, sir, this is one: the Bible says that every man
in order to be a Christian must have a change wrought
in him called conversion, which to my mind is simply
a change of opinion, with results which could be effected
by other means. Socrates was made good by philosophy;
and men of all opinions, even Mohammedan and
Hindoo, have been made moral by the good in their
systems. What we are to aim at is a perfect moral
code free from superstition and spiritual tyranny."</p>

<p>"You must, my good friend, judge of a system by its
general influence, as well as by its effect upon the individual;
and I suppose that you would not like society
to go back from the Christian to the heathen state, because
there may have been moral heathens; or to live
under the government of Turk or Hindoo, because some
individuals among them have practised virtue. Now it
occurs to me that you may not be quite clear in your
views of the Christian system which you reject. It consists
not of moral principles, which are its results,&mdash;but
of a new life,&mdash;the communication of Divine influences.
Let me illustrate this by your occupation. It is your
duty to connect the band of this engine with the various
machines; and thus by an act of yours a mass of inert
mechanism instantaneously becomes subject to complicated
motion, and invested with great power. It is
so with the inner world of man's spiritual being, which
has its facts as well as the outer and material. The soul
of man has wonderful powers and capabilities, even
when inert, in a state of spiritual deadness, resembling
the machinery around us, until the steam force is communicated
to it. Man in a state of nature is dead and
incapable of loving <i>God</i>, or otherwise exercising the
powers of his higher being; but the ever blessed Creator,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
by an act of clemency, pardons sinners who believe
in Jesus, and gives His Holy Spirit to them. These
divinely influenced persons form the Church of Christ,
and of them the sayings of this Book are true: 'And
you hath He quickened who were dead in trespasses and
sins.' 'Not by works of righteousness which we have
done, but according to His mercy He saved us, by
the washing of regeneration and renewing of the Holy
Ghost.'"</p>

<p>The man, who had listened with rapt attention, rose
from his seat, and said with emotion, "I see it all, sir,
as if scales had fallen from my eyes. I have had my
machinery, philosophy, science, Bible, and all sorts of
books, but I have never prayed, 'Give me Thy Holy
Spirit.'"</p>

<p>"Utter that prayer," said his instructor, "in the name
of the well-beloved Son, and you shall be endued with
power from on high; for He has said, 'I will give my
Holy Spirit to them that ask Me.'"</p>

<p>As the time for setting the machinery in motion had
arrived, the visitor promised him a book on infidelity;
and after shaking hands with the new acquaintance,
made his way through the annex.</p>

<p>Several other visits followed, and as the blessed result,
the man believed on the Saviour, and gave evidence of
having passed from death unto life. A clergyman who
visited the place a few months after, wrote of him,
"Among others I spoke to a man in charge of
machinery; a frank, open-faced, and as I should think,
open-hearted Englishman. 'I was, sir,' said he, 'an
infidel, until a gentleman spoke to me here, and gave
me a Gospel. He then reasoned with me, and lent me
a book. I am now persuaded that the Bible is true,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
and I am trying to be a Christian.' I think he has the
root of the matter in him."</p>

<p>The readiness with which this man received the
Gospel is exceptional. With sceptics of his class
prejudice is usually so strong that to remove it is
like working through a granite wall; and, after years of
effort, the good frequently appears to be lost upon
them. Such an incident is therefore a great encouragement
to trust in the power of revealed truth.</p>

<p>The reproving of sin is also a plain Christian duty,
and yet how few nerve themselves to do it. Besides,
persons who, for instance, are guilty of profane language,
not only show their need of good counsel, but their very
words give the judicious Christian a kind of introduction
to them, which can be used to advantage. We will give
two instances in illustration of this use of the Book.</p>

<p>When travelling in Yorkshire, the visitor one morning
lost his train at a junction, and had to remain in the
waiting-room for some time. Three young men entered,
who proved to be a barrister's and two solicitor's clerks.
One of them in his disappointment at not being in time,
as he had to attend a barrister at the assize, uttered
an oath, and another took the Divine Name with worse
than lightness upon his lips.</p>

<p>"Be careful, gentlemen," observed the stranger, "or
you will never discover the legal title."</p>

<p>"What on earth do you mean?" inquired the swearer.</p>

<p>"Just this: there are possessions of present value,
and a heavenly inheritance covenanted and held direct
from the king, but the profane and corrupt will never be
able to prove their legal claim to them."</p>

<p>"It was a slip of the tongue, sir, as I don't swear,"
said the young man, with some confusion.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span></p>

<p>"Then be careful," was the reply, "not to contract a
habit so vile."</p>

<p>As they had to wait an hour, the reprover produced
his pocket Bible, and to interest them in the truth,
compared the Old Testament to a court of law&mdash;stern
law, in which no sinner living can be justified; and the
New Testament to a court of equity, in which the
highest legal Authority in the universe has pronounced
sinners, who believe on Jesus, "Justified from all things
from which they could not be justified by the law of
Moses." After this, he impressively read the words:
"The Spirit itself beareth witness with our spirits that
we are the children of God; and if children, then heirs,
heirs of God, and joint-heirs with Christ." As the train
approached the station, the young men thanked their
reprover, and there was hearty hand-shaking.</p>

<p>The second instance occurred under exceptional
circumstances, for the conversation took place at the
top of an omnibus. Late one fine summer evening a
Christian man was seated at that pleasant elevation,
when, as they passed a club in Pall Mall, a gentleman
came out, ascended to the top, and lit his cigar. As
they passed along, he made a most improper remark
concerning some low people who were quarrelling at
the corner of a street.</p>

<p>"Your sympathies," observed the man addressed,
"are evidently with those persons: as we say in chemistry,
there is attraction, an affinity between you."&mdash;</p>

<p>"Thanks for the high estimate you have formed of
me," said the gentleman in an angry tone.</p>

<p>"A very right way to estimate a stranger," was the
reply, "as to judge a man out of his own mouth is a
very proper judgment. There are only two orders of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
men&mdash;the natural or corrupt, and those who have been
made pure in heart. Had you belonged to the latter,
those bad people would have caused a revulsion of
feeling within you; instead of that you spoke with
sympathy, and I therefore as a moralist come to the
conclusion that impurity attracts you instead of holiness."</p>

<p>This remark was followed by a long silence, when the
gentleman turned suddenly toward his reprover and
inquired,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Are you a religious man?"</p>

<p>"Yes: I am."</p>

<p>"Then your reproof of my thoughtless words was
very proper; but to unchristianize a fellow for such a
remark is really too bad."</p>

<p>"I did not unchristianize you, but gave honestly the
impression your words conveyed to my mind. And
now by way of apology for the sharp manner in which I
spoke, may I return your question: 'Are you a religious
man?'"</p>

<p>"Well, yes: I am certainly baptized, and am regular
in attendance at church with my family; but after all
I am not quite right, as there are mysteries in the faith
which trouble me."</p>

<p>"Are you a new creature in Christ Jesus?"</p>

<p>"That doctrine has no doubt a depth of meaning and
much beauty in it, but I can only see the beauty. With
me it is not a reality, as the longer I live the more difficult
it is for me to conceive of the <i>Almighty God</i> and
a vile creature, an unit among hundreds of millions,
holding intercourse and affecting a transaction between
them."</p>

<p>"And yet such is the fact, established by the verities<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
of the Truth Himself, who has said, 'Your heavenly
Father will give His Holy Spirit to them that ask Him.'"
And then pressing the arm of the gentleman, the speaker
continued, "It is thus: just as matter can influence
matter, so can spirit influence spirit. Your body feels
the grasp of my hand, and it is as possible for your soul
to be touched by the Holy Spirit of God and to be made
conscious of that blessed influence."</p>

<p>The conversation was continued, and deepened in
interest until the omnibus came to the end of its journey
in the suburb. The passengers alighted, and then the
gentleman in a most graceful way said, "You have, sir,
reproved me wisely, and made the truth, which for years
has disturbed me, so plain, that duty to myself requires
me to ask your friendship, certainly for the favour of
another long conversation."</p>

<p>"I am much occupied," was the reply, "but will
gladly spare an hour or so to-morrow evening, should
you be disengaged."</p>

<p>"Then I will give you my card, and will remain at
home to receive you. I have only to ask you as a point
of honour not to mention my foolish remark."</p>

<p>The promise was given, and the gentleman handed
his card to the religious teacher, who was startled at the
rank of the man to whom he had spoken so faithfully;
but addressing him by his title, he endeavoured to fix
the Scripture in his mind: "If any man be in Christ he
is a new creature: old things have passed away; behold,
all things have become new."</p>

<p>Upon the next evening the promised visit was paid,
and the stranger was introduced by his new friend to
the family circle. For a time his lady was reserved (as
well she might be), but after an hour's converse about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
"things spiritual," she became genial and kind. Before
he left, the servants were called in, and the Missionary
read and gave a short exposition of the chapter commencing
with the words: "And you hath He quickened
who were dead in trespasses and sins;" after which he
engaged in extempore prayer.</p>

<p>This was the first of many pleasant visits, and the
commencement of a friendship with the family which
had its proof of blessing,&mdash;certainly with its head, who
received the doctrine of regeneration in its fulness.
When a believer is impressed with the duty of witnessing
for God, opportunities for doing so are sure to occur,
and if he keeps simply to the Bible, good will of necessity
result. He may speak with conscious feebleness,
but his infirmity has nothing to do with the matter.
The secret of success in Christian work is humility before
God and meekness of wisdom before men, united with
firm faith in the truth and power of the Divine Word.
That Word can be spoken by, but can gain no improvement
or strength from man. All experience gives proof
of this, and we add two narratives, in confirmation of
others, which show that the lodgment of passages from
the Holy Scriptures is sufficient to accomplish the purposes
of grace.</p>

<p>A Christian man was in the studio of a celebrated
sculptor, fixing upon designs for the first drinking-fountains
erected in London. When the order was given
for cutting passages of Scripture in the solid granite,
the sculptor objected, upon the ground of "leading the
vulgar to despise the Scriptures, by making its words
common." The point was reasoned with him, and the
position taken, "that any word of God may lead the
thoughts of men up to Him, and that the honouring of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
His truth must therefore be attended with beneficial
results." The order was carried out, and for years the
drinking-fountains of London have at the same time
refreshed the people with pure water, and instructed
them in words of heavenly wisdom. Upon one of them,
in the Edgeware Road, is the Proverb, "The fear of the
Lord is a fountain of life." One evening two young
men passed it. The eldest was a barman, and the other
was his youngest brother, who had just come up from
the country. They had planned the robbery of the
master in this way: the youth was to enter the bar as a
stranger, to call for liquor, and to hand his brother sixpence;
change for a sovereign or half-sovereign, according
to the money in the till, was then to be handed
back to him. This was to be repeated several times
during the evening, and next day they were to meet
and divide the spoil. As they passed the fountain the
eye of the youth caught the inscription, "The fear of
the Lord is a fountain of life," and he gazed at it with
riveted attention. The teaching received at Sunday-school
and a succession of corresponding Scriptures
flashed into his mind. Turning to his brother, he said,
"God will see us, and I dare not do this thieving."
Next Sunday he attended a meeting of "The Young
Men's Christian Association," and soon after became a
decided Christian. Who can tell how many have been
thus blessed by Wisdom making her voice heard in the
public ways!</p>

<p>The other instance was that of an opportunity being
embraced of speaking faithfully to eighteen highly intelligent
young men. They had assembled in a classroom
at the Royal Polytechnic, to receive instruction
from a professor in chemistry. A Christian man had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
occasion to enter the room, and upon being informed
that several of the young men were telegraph clerks, he
reminded them that the word "religion" in Latin really
meant "binding again,&mdash;the re-uniting of a broken
communication;" and added, "This is the condition of
us all in our natural estate. Communication is cut off
between the sinner and the <i>Almighty Creator</i>. Faith in
the Lord Jesus and the reception of the Holy Spirit
are the only means by which communication can be
re-established between the creature on earth and the
offended Majesty of heaven; as it is written, 'Ye who
sometimes were far off are made nigh by the blood of
Christ.'"</p>

<p>More than a year after this circumstance a young
man lay upon his death-bed. A rapid consumption had
reduced him to a shadow, and when he felt the end
drawing nigh, he sent for the Christian visitor, to thank
him for speaking so clearly of Jesus in the hall of many
sciences. He was at that time "far off," but by faith
in the risen Lord he had obtained mercy, and a blessed
hope of everlasting life. He spoke of "the comfort of
prayer," and "his sweet anticipation of glory," as proofs
that communication had been established between him
and the Father of his spirit. Soon after this he fell
asleep in Jesus. In him the great object of the Church
in all her labours was accomplished. Being ignorant,
he was instructed in saving truth. Being separated
from his <i>God</i>, he was drawn by the cords of Divine
love; and then, being assured of resurrection life in
Jesus, he laid down his mortal body that he might
follow with the ransomed of the Lord, who enter Zion
with songs, and everlasting joy upon their heads.</p>

<p>This great good resulted from one Scripture being<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
fixed in the mind of that young man, "But now in
Christ Jesus, ye who sometimes were far off are made
nigh by the blood of Christ." To every Christian the
Word is committed, and it is the duty of all to use it for
the spiritual enlightenment of others. All whose communication
with heaven has not been re-established,
must be instructed in the saving truths of Holy Scripture.
Opportunities to instruct the intellectual and the higher
social classes in the grand but simple truths of salvation
must not be lost; but to the poor the Gospel must be
preached. They were and ever will be the objects of
the deep solicitude of our Lord. He in a special manner
was their Teacher: for them as for others He lived and
agonized and died. They must not be permitted, as in
our great cities, to continue in ignorance and sin, and
with multitudes to die the death that is eternal. The
Church universal must answer, "No!" She must gird
on her strength, and convey the Book of God, which
sheds the light of His salvation, into every dark dwelling,&mdash;that
redemption's work may spread, and the
people learn righteousness, to their salvation and to the
praise of the glory of Divine grace.</p>

<h2>APPENDIX.</h2>


<h3>CAN YOU INFLUENCE THE WORLD
FOR CHRIST?</h3>

<div class="drop">
<img src="images/idrop_t.jpg" alt="T" width="66" height="107" class="cap" />
<p class="cap_1">TO a large extent it is believed that you can!
God in His providence <i>has brought within
your</i> reach representatives of the various
nations of the Globe; and has placed them
in the best possible position to influence the
whole earth; so that <i>if you act upon them, you
act upon the world</i>!</p>
</div>

<p>But where is this great gathering of the representatives
of the nations to be found? Our minds at once
advert to London, the Metropolis of the United Kingdom
and of the whole earth!&mdash;the Modern Babylon!&mdash;a
city which now contains nearly four millions of inhabitants!</p>

<p>Are you a Scotchman? There are about as many
Scotch people and their descendants in London, as
there are in Edinburgh? Are you an Irishman? There
are more Irish and their descendants in London, than
there are in Dublin! Are you a Welshman? The
Welsh and their descendants living in London about
equal the united populations of six of the principal
Welsh towns? Or are you an Englishman? The
population of six, eight, or ten towns in some of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
English counties, represent the number of persons <i>born
in those counties</i>, who now live in the great city! You
may thus act upon almost every city, town, and village
in the United Kingdom by means of their own representatives
now living in London.</p>

<p>And if you should specially pity the poor Jew, because
he rejects the great Messiah;&mdash;then you should
remember that there are more Jews in London than
there are in Palestine! If, again, you regard Popery as
the great Antichrist; you are reminded that there are
more Roman Catholics in London than there are in
Rome! Its 2,000 <span class="smcap">Italians</span> can here be prepared to
carry home to their countrymen the glad tidings of a
completed salvation! Are German Neology and French
Infidelity the foes to the Redeemer which you would
oppose? It is affirmed that above 60,000 <span class="smcap">Germans</span>, or
their descendants, and about 40,000 <span class="smcap">French</span> and their
children, are now to be found in London! The mighty
Russian Empire, with its Sclavonian races, sunk in ignorance,
or in the corruptions of the Greek Church, is
numerously represented in London! Some 6,000 <span class="smcap">Mohammedans
and East Indian</span> idolaters are also
found yearly in London! and <i>there</i>, with perfect safety,
can be taught that there is one God, and one atoning
sacrifice. <i>There</i> also are found vast numbers of Danes,
Dutch, Swedes, Swiss, Spaniards, Portuguese, Greeks,
Turks, Africans, Arabians, Persians, Chinese, Brazilians,
Americans, American Indians, West-Indian, and South
Sea Islanders, and probably from every other nation
under heaven! These are brought together by Divine
Providence, no doubt, that they may be instructed in
the wonderful works of God. <span class="smcap">These representatives
of the nations of the earth are brought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>
within your reach; and through them, by the
aid of the London City Mission, you can influence
the world for Christ.</span> Alas, that these
representative bodies should have entered a city in
which a million and three-quarters of its people cannot
find room to worship God in its Protestant Churches
and Chapels!&mdash;a city in which myriads of its inhabitants
are addicted to crime.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The London City Mission</span> enables Christians to
act on individuals of every class and nation resident
in this most important spot of the earth, this <i>diseased</i>
<span class="smcap">heart</span> <i>of the body politic of the world</i>. The simple
object of the Society is to take the Gospel to every
house, garret, and cellar, and to beseech men to be
reconciled to God. It knows nothing of sects nor
parties, nor does it seek to proselytize in any other way
than to make the wicked holy, and the worthless valuable
members of society. Its Missionaries, 450 in
number, communicate the Gospel in twenty-three languages,
each to about 2,000 persons. But if each
Missionary employed continues to have about 2,000
persons to visit, <span class="smcap">at least 400 more Missionaries
are required for the monster city</span>. Who then is
willing to endeavour&mdash;by personal consecration, or by
helping an agency that is ready at hand, fitted for the
work, and blessed in the doing of it&mdash;to <i>influence the
world for Christ</i>?</p>

<h2>CONSTITUTION.</h2>


<p>I. The name&mdash;"The London City Mission."</p>

<p>II. The object of this Institution is to extend the knowledge of
the Gospel among the inhabitants of London and its vicinity
(especially the poor) without any reference to denominational
distinctions, or the peculiarities of Church Government.</p>

<p>III. To effect this object, Missionaries of approved character
and qualifications, who shall give themselves entirely to the work,
shall be employed and paid by the Institution. Their duty shall be
to visit from house to house in the respective Districts that shall be
assigned to them, read the Scriptures, engage in religious conversation,
and urge those who are living in the neglect of religion to
observe the Sabbath and to attend public worship. They shall also
see that all persons possess the Scriptures, shall distribute approved
religious tracts, and aid in obtaining Scriptural education
for the children of the poor. By the approval of the Committee,
they shall hold meetings for reading and expounding the Scriptures
and prayer, and shall adopt such other means as the Committee
may think necessary for the accomplishment of the Mission.</p>

<p>IV. As the object of the Mission is to extend the knowledge of
the Gospel, it is a fundamental law that the following doctrines be
prominently taught by the Agents and publications of the Mission.
They are given, "not in the words which man's wisdom teacheth,
but which the Holy Ghost teacheth."<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> "All have sinned and come

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292"></a></span>V. The general business of the London City Mission shall be
conducted by a Committee consisting of an equal number of members
of the Established Church and of Dissenters; and the Examiners
of Missionaries shall consist of an equal number of Clergymen
and Dissenting Ministers, all of whom, with the Treasurers, Secretaries,
and Auditors, shall be members of the Committee, <i>ex officio</i>.</p>

<p>VI. Persons subscribing one guinea annually; every donor of
10; an executor on the payment of a legacy of 50 and upwards;
and Clergymen of the Established Church, and Dissenting Ministers,
as representatives of their congregations, who subscribe or
collect for the Mission the sum of 5 annually, shall be members
of the Institution.</p>

<p>VII. A General Meeting shall be held annually in May (and
oftener if necessary) to appoint the office-bearers, and receive a
Report of the proceedings of the Mission and of the state of the
funds. All matters proposed shall be determined by the majority
of the Members present. The Meeting shall be opened and concluded
by prayer, and the President for the day shall sign the
Minutes of the proceedings. In connection with the Annual
Meeting, one Sermon, or more, shall be preached, of which due
notice shall be given.</p>

<p>VIII. The funds of the Mission, arising from donations, legacies,
subscriptions, collections, etc., shall be expended, under the direction
of the Committee, upon the salaries of Missionaries, the purchase
of tracts, and in meeting all necessary charges in conducting
the business of the Mission.</p>

<p>IX. That no alteration be made in this Constitution, except at
an Annual Meeting, or General Meeting, specially convened by the
Committee, upon a requisition stating the nature of the alteration,
signed by fifty of the members, and to be held within twenty-one
days of the receipt of such requisition.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span></p>
<hr style="width: 45%;" />
<p>We give the following extract of speeches delivered at the last, or Forty-third
Annual Meeting of the London City Mission, which was held in Exeter
Hall, on Thursday, May 2nd, 1878; Lord <span class="smcap">Kinnaird</span> in the Chair.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>The large assembly having sung three verses of the hymn,</p>

<div class="poem">
<span class="i0">"All hail the great Immanuel's name,"</span>
</div>

<p>the Rev. <span class="smcap">Josiah Miller</span> read a portion of Scripture and offered prayer,
after which&mdash;</p>

<p>The Meeting was addressed by the <span class="smcap">Chairman</span> as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>I have been asked to preside on this special occasion from the fact that
I believe I am one of the oldest members on service on this Committee.
For upwards of forty years I have been permitted to join in this great and
important work, and I can only say that each year, as it rolled on, I felt
more and more thankful that this work was flourishing and advancing.
When it began its work in London, the principles on which it was founded
were not so generally recognised as they are now. I well remember, for
instance, when we had to contend for the very principle of lay agency in
quarters where now it would be frankly recognised. Three principles seem
to underlie all our work. First, that evangelical truth has the only claim
for recognition as being in full accordance with the Word of God, and as
being fitted to persuade men to be reconciled to God. Secondly, that the
duty of proclaiming it does not exclusively rest on ordained ministers, but
that all men share the obligation, which flows from the Divine command
to go into all the world and preach the Gospel to every creature, and also
to go into the lanes and hedges and invite men to the Gospel feast. And
thirdly, that the members of the one Church of Christ, though connected
with various denominations, should combine in the work of evangelization,
thus manifesting in some degree the unity for which the Saviour prayed,
and proving to men that the points on which they agree are of far more
deep and lasting importance than those on which they differ. The steady
growth of our London population, which, when Mr. Hoare and myself
began, was about a million and a half, but which is now rapidly approaching
four millions, makes the need of this Society, in some respects, even
greater than it was when it first started. We may be very thankful that so
much has been accomplished through its instrumentality, and very thankful,
too, that other kindred Societies have sprung into existence following
in our steps. But I would impress upon you that there must be no relaxation
of effort on our part. Perhaps no claim could be stronger than that
connected with the evangelization of special classes, which is the peculiar
feature of this Society. It has been my privilege at different times to
superintend many missionaries, and especially those to foreigners. That
work is continuing, and we may thank God for it. What should we now
do without the City missionary? In any moment of perplexity, when new
difficulties arise, one generally has to seek the aid of an experienced missionary
to help in starting a movement for the relief of some evident
spiritual want. My own experience is, that it has pleased God in a marvellous
way to use this Society for the advancement of His kingdom. We
must not, however, try to monopolize. There are Scripture readers, and,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
above all, there is that wonderful instrumentality of the Bible-woman and
the Bible-nurse. The idea of these has been taken from us. We were the
pioneers in the work. God has blessed it, and it is apparently prospering.
There are fields of labour amongst our increasing population, which, but
for such an agency as this, would make us tremble for our great City. I
had hoped to have seen here our excellent friend Mr. Garwood, whose
labours have been perfectly indefatigable. But though he is absent in
body he is with us in spirit. It has been very refreshing during the past
year to see him constantly attending our Committees, as earnest and warm
a friend to the work as ever he was in his younger days. Long may he be
spared to us, to give us the benefit of his sage counsels. I have now to
call upon the Secretary to read the Report. It is one full of deep interest,
and I trust that you will give it your earnest attention.</p>

<p>The Rev. <span class="smcap">J. P. A. Fletcher</span> then read an abstract of the Report of
the Society for the past year.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>The Bishop of <span class="smcap">Sodor</span> and <span class="smcap">Man</span>:&mdash;My Lord, I have to move the first
Resolution:&mdash;</p>

<p>"That the Report, an abstract of which has now been read, be adopted,
printed, and circulated, under the direction of the Committee."</p>

<p>I should have been very much wanting in gratitude if I had failed to respond
at once to the kind invitation that was sent to me, asking me to take
part in the proceedings of to-day; for I shall always look back with pleasure
to my connection with the City Mission when I was a working clergyman
in London. Only this morning, as I was coming to this meeting, I
met a gentleman who said to me, "Where are you off to? Which of the
meetings are you going to attend?" I said, "I am going to the anniversary
of the City Mission." "Oh," said he, "but that is not a Church of England
Society." "No," I said, "but it is an old friend of mine; it is an
unsectarian Society." When I was a clergyman working in London, the
City Mission gave me support in two parishes; and now I am made a
Bishop, I am not going to refuse to give my support to the City Mission.
The truth is, there is room enough in this vast city of London for all the
Societies that are working for the spread of God's truth. We could afford
to have twice as many Societies; and if all the City missionaries, and Scripture
readers, and Bible-women, and district visitors, were quadrupled in
number, there would be room enough for all, and we should want more.
But the benefit of such Societies is not only to be found in their evangelistic
work&mdash;that they carry the Gospel of the grace of God to the masses&mdash;but I
take it that it is to be found above all in the fact that they unite Christian
people together for the Lord's work. This is what we especially want in
the present day. The enemy is carrying on his work with the greatest
activity. The Lord's people must be united, and I rejoice in the working
of such Societies as this, because they bring Christian people together, and
unite them in the grand common object of the advancement of the Redeemer's
kingdom. It is now some years ago since I first entered upon the work of
my first parish in London. I received a district of 10,000 people in the
parish of Marylebone, cut off from St. Mary's, Bryanston Square. There
were no rich people in the district, and I had to set about the work with
many difficulties to contend with. I had the help of a Scripture reader, a
Pastoral-aid worker, and three Bible-women, but still that was not sufficient.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>
As we went on with the work we found a City missionary working in one
corner of the district, and we found that he got hold of the people that we
were getting hold of. I felt, "This will never do, because we are treading
upon each other's heels." So I went to the Committee of the Society and
represented the case to them. I said, "We have got a common object in
view; we only want to take the Gospel to the masses. I am unfortunately
in this position: that I cannot go beyond my bounds. I am tied by the
parochial system (a very good system, too). Now, I will undertake the
superintendence of the missionary if you will kindly let me do so." The
Committee at once said they would, and from that time I began to work
heartily in connection with the City Mission. But this was not the end of
my connection. I was asked to undertake what I believe to be a most
important part in the work of the Society; I was asked to become one of
the examiners of the City missionaries. I say this is perhaps the most
important part of the whole work, for our success very much depends upon
the men whom we select to carry on the work. There is a tendency in the
present day for men to take up this kind of work when everything else fails.
Well, that will never do. We must not have this work undertaken simply
as a profession. We want men constrained by the love of Christ; we
want men with an accurate knowledge of the Word of God to go and deal
with the masses of the people; and if we have not this class of men as our
City missionaries, the work will fail sooner or later. We may have five
hundred City missionaries, but unless they are men of God, unless they
know the Word of God, they will never carry out the work of God. I
look back, therefore, with the greatest pleasure upon my connection with
this Society. I dare say there are some missionaries now before me
who have passed through my hands. I hope they did not find me very
severe; but if they did, I can tell them that I was only severe in my examination
of them because I was anxious about the good of the Society.
The question before us this morning, as it seems to me, is, How can we
stir one another up to take greater interest in the work? I believe there
are three things which are necessary. We need first of all a deep sense of
our responsibility in the sight of God; we need secondly a keen sense of
sin in God's sight; and, last of all, we need a lively sense of God's presence
and power with us. I believe these three things are necessary, and
I am substantiated in that conviction by a reference to three of the greatest
City Missions that we find mentioned in the Word of God. We have a
grand work before us in connection with London, the largest city in the
world that was ever seen, but I do not think that we must run away with
the idea that London is worse than other places; the only thing is, that
we have so much evil brought together, with its seven or eight thousand
streets, and its nearly four millions of population. It is a tremendous place,
but after all I do not think upon London as worse than other places. It
is, so to speak, the heart of the world. The blood flows from London
throughout the world, and therefore, if we are to deal with the world outside,
we must deal with the heart. We must bring the Gospel to bear
upon the masses of London, and then we shall do a mighty work for the
world. There are three grand essentials that we need in carrying out the
work, and I would substantiate this by a short reference to three of the
greatest City Missions that we read of in the Word of God. I said, in the
first place, that we need a true sense of our responsibility in the sight of
God. The portion of Scripture which has been read to us reminds us of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>
Nineveh and the Mission to that city. It was a vast city, somewhat on the
scale of London, but its wickedness had gone up to heaven. God commanded
His prophet Jonah to go and call it to repentance, but he went on
board ship and tried to flee from the presence of God. He went down
into the cabin and fell asleep. It was not till a storm sent by God aroused
him&mdash;it was not till the captain put his hand upon his shoulder, and said,
"What meanest thou, O sleeper? Arise, call upon thy God," that he
was awakened to a sense of his responsibility. I believe there are many
just in the condition of Jonah, and it is not till the world makes an appeal
to them that they are aroused. For you will notice that it was not a man
of God who awakened Jonah to a sense of his responsibility, but it was a
man of the world, the captain of the ship, a heathen. Dear friends, the
world wants us to speak to it. There are people around us who want us
to take the Gospel to them. They know what our privileges and blessings
are. But how is it with many? They just flee from the presence of God;
they go down into the sides of the ship and fall asleep. We need, then,
first of all, in our Mission to this great City, a true sense of our responsibility
and duty in the sight of God. But let me remind you of another city of
quite a different character, blessed with every privilege of a religious kind&mdash;the
city of Jerusalem. Though that city had every blessing which God
could shower on it, the people rejected God in all His love, and grace, and
kindness. Their wickedness may have been of a different kind, but it was
as great in the sight of God as that of Nineveh. The Lord Jesus Christ
Himself came as the great Missionary to that city&mdash;the city of His love.
He beheld the city and wept over it; its sins, its wickedness, its rejection
of God's love, drew tears from His eyes, and He said, "If thou hadst
known, even thou, at least in this thy day, the things that belong unto thy
peace! but now they are hid from thine eyes." And as I think of that, I
learn the second grand essential for us of a keen sense of sin. Oh! if you
realize more and more the wickedness of this great City, you would be more
and more constrained to work, so as to let others know of that Saviour
who has proved so precious to you. Lastly, let me refer you to another
Mission&mdash;the Mission to the city of Corinth. It was the centre of the commercial
world; through it flowed all the wealth from the East and the
West; and as it was famous for its wealth, so it was notorious for its vice.
We are told of the Apostle Paul visiting that city for the first time, and being
discouraged; but we are told that the Lord appeared to Paul in a vision
and said, "Fear not, Paul; be not afraid; I am with thee. I have much
people in this city." So he was encouraged in his work. He went forward
in the cause of the Lord with his hands strengthened with the blessed
assurance that the Lord was with him. Let me, in conclusion, remind you
what a glorious work is performed in this Society. If we are only true to
God, God will be true to us. His promise is sure. His people shall be
gathered out. As we look at the various discouragements, difficulties, and
trials with which we have to contend, we can go forward with hope and
firm assurance, remembering that blessed promise, that He has prepared
for us a city.</p>

<p>The Rev. Dr. <span class="smcap">Manning</span> (Secretary of the Religious Tract Society):&mdash;Ten
minutes ago my name stood last upon the list of speakers. That, of course,
meant that I was not to speak at all; that was the clear and obvious inference
from the place in which I was put, and it is only fair to say that I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>
was put in that position at my own urgent request, not having time to prepare
anything to say to you to-day. In the absence of Mr. Waddy, I
venture, very unexpectedly, to stand in the gap to second the Resolution so
ably moved by the Bishop of Sodor and Man. The other day I was
reading the memoirs of the late eminent aural surgeon, and scarcely less
eminent a metaphysician, the late James Hinton, who, on one occasion,
found himself in one of the very vilest haunts of London, surrounded by
the most abandoned and depraved of this great city. He spoke to them
of Jesus of Nazareth, and told them how, through Him, they might reascend
to virtue and hopefulness; and then, his eyes brimming with tears,
he turned to a gentleman who was accompanying him, and said, "If the
Lord Jesus were back again upon earth where would He be? He would
be here." And then with emotion, he turned away. So, when I think
of the work of the City Mission, when I remember that I have before me
some four hundred or four hundred and fifty agents of this Society, who are
descending into the very depths of misery and vice, carrying with them the
tidings of the great salvation, I cannot but think, in the words of James
Hinton, if the Lord were here upon earth, He would be at the very work
to which you, my friends, have been called, and in which this great Society
is commissioning and sustaining you. Therefore, with very deep sympathy,
I bid you God-speed, and rejoice with you in that very affecting and even
eloquent (not so much in words as in facts) Report to which we have just
listened. During the meetings of this week, and of this month, I wonder
how often our Lord's great commission will have been quoted, "Go into
all the world and preach the Gospel to every creature." However often it
may be quoted, it cannot be quoted too often; and yet in this meeting
especially, one cannot but remember that there is a certain limitation imposed
upon the disciples&mdash;"beginning at Jerusalem." Why? It seems to me
that almost every ground and reason which prompted that limitation to
begin at Jerusalem, may by fair application and analogy, be brought to bear
upon the work in which you are engaged. Throwing out of account the
special position of the Jewish people, which, of course, entered into our
Lord's consideration, what is the meaning of that limitation as applied to
us? I think, first of all, it may teach us the duty of beginning the work
which lies next to hand. They were at Jerusalem, and they, therefore,
began where they were&mdash;began at once, and on the spot where the Master
placed and found them. There is a proverb often misquoted and mis-applied,
to which, however, I do attach extreme importance, that "Charity
begins at home." I would not give much for the charity which does not
begin at home, as I would not give much for the charity which ends there.
The charity which is good for anything, and which the Gospel inspires, and
which the Master teaches, is the charity that begins at our own door, and
with the work which lies next to hand. In this great mission work for the
world there is very much of romance;</p>

<div class="poem">
<span class="i0">"Its distance lends enchantment to the view,</span>
<span class="i0">And gilds the mountain with its azure hue."</span>
</div>

<p>And thank God for all that romance which prompts the imagination to
enlist itself on the side of conscience. In this work of ours, however,
there is little of romance; there is shown hard, terrible reality, vice in all
its gaunt, hideous, and repulsive forms, which has to be grappled with;
but, thank God, there are faithful men who will begin at London, this million-peopled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>
city, with all its manifold share of vice, as the disciples began
at Jerusalem. Then there is another point to which the Lord Bishop, who
has just sat down, has adverted&mdash;that Jerusalem was the great centre of
world-wide activity. "Parthians and Medes, and Elamites, and the dwellers
in Mesopotamia"&mdash;every nation on earth was there represented; for at
that time the Jew, as to-day, was the world's banker, carrying on the commerce
of the world, and found in every city of the world. Is not that the
position of London to-day? When the great Jew banker, Rothschild, some
years ago was under examination by a Committee of the House of Commons,
he was asked what was the influence upon the exchanges of the
world of an alteration in the rate of discount in London, and he rose almost
to a strain of poetry in his reply. "Gentlemen," he said, "London
is the heart of the world, and every pulse and throb of the London market
is felt in every part of the world." Why, my Lord, wherever commerce is
spread, the power of England is felt; wherever trade is carried on, the sails
of our ships whiten every sea, and the agents and missionaries of commerce
are found dauntless and fearless in the pursuit of gain. Oh! what would
the world soon be if this great London of ours were converted to God, if
from this great centre of civilization and commerce there should go forth,
not only men seeking earthly gain, but men who would carry with them, in
the transactions of their lawful business, the love of Christ in their hearts,
and the message of salvation upon their lips! From this London of ours
an influence would spread over the whole world, and tens of thousands of
volunteer and unpaid missionaries would go forth, without fee or reward, to
carry the glad tidings of salvation. Then our Lord in His ministry always
appealed to kinship. Andrew findeth his own brother Simon, and
then they go and find their friend and fellow-townsman, Nathaniel, and to
each one the glad tidings are communicated, "We have found the Christ."
"Go, call thy husband, and come hither." This sense of family relationship,
friendship, and personal attachment is used to spread the Gospel. And
we, too, are to remember that our kinsmen and brethren are, first of all,
to receive from us the glad tidings of great joy&mdash;the heathen not forgotten,
but the heathen at our own doors, bound to us by ties of brotherhood, are
to have the first message of the Gospel. Then there is patriotism. How
proud the Hebrew has ever been of his ancestor! With what pride the
Apostle again and again boasts that he is "of the stock of Israel, of the
tribe of Benjamin!" You look back upon that long line of heroes, of
whom the world was not worthy. My Lord Kinnaird, we have a history
behind us only second in nobleness to that of the Jew. We are born of
earth's best blood, and have titles manifold. Admitting all the crimes of
which our nation has been guilty, I yet thank God&mdash;and in that sentiment
I but utter the feelings of every British heart&mdash;that I am born a Briton.
Therefore it behoves us, as Britons, to spread far and wide throughout our
beloved and honoured land that which can carry on its liberties and its
prosperity to a yet higher height. Not very long ago I was standing before
one of those meetings in the Faubourg St. Antoine, organized by that wonderful
man, Robert McAll, who is carrying on that marvellous City Mission
in Paris. I stood there amidst a crowd of gaunt, hollow-eyed Communists
and Red Republicans, with their long dishevelled hair, and white, haggard
faces, and I said to them, "I come simply to tell you what it is that has
made England free and prosperous and happy. Our hearts have bled for
you in the calamities which you in these recent years have endured. What<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span>
can lift you up from this abyss of ruin into which you have fallen? What
is it that can make you partakers with us of those national privileges which
we enjoy? It is the Gospel, and nothing but the Gospel. Let London
and Paris be found side by side falling at the feet of Jesus, and these two
great master cities of the world will yet win the world for Christ!" Then
there is just one further consideration to which reference has already been
made why the Gospel was to begin at Jerusalem: it was the city of profoundest
guilt and deepest need. At the point where the Lord Bishop left
off in his touching allusion to Jerusalem, they were already plotting and
conspiring not only to reject but to crucify the Lord of Life; and the
agonies of His dying cries had scarcely ceased from the hills of Jerusalem,
and His blood was scarcely dry upon the stones when He prayed upon the
cross, "Father, forgive them, they know not what they do;" and said to
His disciples, "Go to these, my murderers, these men by whose wicked
hands I have been crucified and slain, and as they are deepest in guilt and
extremest in need, to them let the first offer of salvation come." And may
not this, in some respects, be applied to London, too? Men may speculate
as they will as to the future condition of the heathen world, and of those
who have never heard of Christ, those who have been born in the deep,
dense, awful darkness of heathenism, a darkness which might be felt, which
like the pall of death hangs over those degraded nations; they may speculate
as they will as to the future condition of those to whom the Gospel has
never come, but what must be the terrible, appalling guilt of the millions
of London who are living within the sound of the Gospel, and side by
side with Christian influences and agencies, but who yet remain as utterly
dead and as absolutely heathen as the very idolaters of Central Africa! As
to their guilt and ruin there can be no doubt. We, therefore, who hold in
our hands the glad tidings of salvation, are bound first of all to offer them
to these first in guilt that they may be first in hearing the news of the
Saviour. I have looked through the list which summarizes the action and
agency of the Mission, and I see that nearly three millions of visits have
been paid to homes darkened by misery, ignorance, and vice. Your missionaries
have gone, for what purpose?&mdash;to dispel the cloud, and to bring
peace instead of discord, joy instead of sorrow. How many visitors have
gone to those homes on a different errand? Last night a gentleman, speaking
in this hall, told an anecdote rather droll in its aspect, but which may yet
illustrate the difference between the visits of the missionaries and those of
many others who go to them. A dead body had been cast upon the sands,
and at the coroner's inquest the persons who found it were asked, "Did you
do anything to resuscitate the corpse?" They could not understand the
question, and the Coroner repeated it: "Did you do anything to resuscitate
the corpse?" "Yes," said the men; "We searched his pockets." Now,
that does seem to me to express, in a quaint and droll way, the purpose for
which many go into the homes and haunts of poverty and vice. Our friends,
however, go to teach them, first of all, how to turn a penny into a pound
by temperance, virtue, and religion; and then to give them the yet deeper
blessings of salvation. I cannot sit down without one word of personal
testimony to the work of this Society. I am one of the Secretaries of the
Religious Tract Society. It has been our happiness and privilege to
assist, year by year and increasingly, with large grants of tracts and publications,
the work of this Mission, and its results. I am bound to say that
amongst the most efficient coadjutors of the Religious Tract Society is this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span>
City Mission. There is no quarter in which our tracts are circulated with
more entire confidence and satisfaction to ourselves, and with a firmer assurance
that they will be well and wisely used, and productive of the best
results. I feel, therefore, that while thanks have been from time to time
rendered to the Tract Society for the help which we have rendered you, we
should render you most hearty thanks for the help which you have given to
us; and in the name of our Lord and Master we bid you God-speed.</p>

even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1

Gutenberg-tm License.

     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
